        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        
        <h3>Study Background and Main Findings</h3>
        <p>This study investigated the effects of increasing resistance training volume on muscle hypertrophy and strength in trained males. All groups showed significant increases in regional fat-free mass (ROI-FFM) and muscle thickness (MT), with no significant differences between groups. The control group (CON) surprisingly demonstrated the highest overall 1RM back squat strength gains (p &lt; 0.05), while the group with a 30% volume increase (G30) showed the greatest improvement in repetitions to failure (RTF). These findings suggest that maintaining a moderate training volume can be sufficient for muscle growth and may be superior for maximal strength gains in trained individuals, while a 30% increase in volume might benefit strength-endurance.</p>
        
        <h3>Research Impact and Future Directions</h3>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The study provides valuable insights into the effects of individualized resistance training volume increases on muscle hypertrophy and strength adaptations in trained males. While the results indicate that all groups experienced similar muscle growth, the control group demonstrated superior maximal strength gains, and the 30% increase group showed improved strength-endurance. These findings suggest a complex relationship between training volume and adaptations, highlighting the potential limitations of simply increasing volume for trained individuals and emphasizing the importance of considering individual responses and training goals.</p><p>The study&#x27;s practical utility is somewhat limited by its specific focus on resistance-trained males and the relatively short intervention period. However, the findings challenge the conventional wisdom that &quot;more is always better&quot; when it comes to training volume, suggesting that a moderate volume may be sufficient for muscle growth and even optimal for strength gains in this population. These results are placed within the context of existing literature, although a more thorough comparison with studies on individualized volume increases would further strengthen the discussion.</p><p>Practitioners can use these findings to inform their training recommendations, particularly for experienced lifters. Maintaining a moderate training volume (around 12 weekly sets per muscle group) appears to be a viable strategy for promoting muscle growth and strength gains. While a 30% increase in volume may enhance strength-endurance, further increases may not provide additional benefits and could even hinder strength development. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the study&#x27;s limitations, including the specific population studied, the short-term nature of the intervention, the lack of nutritional control, and the high dropout rate. These factors may limit the generalizability of the findings and warrant caution in their interpretation.</p><p>Several critical questions remain unanswered. The study&#x27;s design does not allow for a definitive determination of the optimal training volume for different populations or training goals. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the unexpected strength gains in the control group are not fully understood. While the methodological limitations, particularly the high dropout rate and lack of nutritional control, do not fundamentally invalidate the conclusions, they do highlight the need for further research with larger sample sizes, longer intervention periods, and more diverse populations. Future studies should also investigate the long-term effects of individualized volume increases and explore the potential influence of other training variables.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Purpose and Rationale:</strong> The study investigated the impact of increasing previous resistance training volume on muscle hypertrophy and strength in resistance-trained men.  Like adding more weight to a car to see how its speed changes, the researchers wanted to understand how changing the training &quot;weight&quot; (volume) affects muscle growth and strength.  This is important because understanding the relationship between training volume and adaptations can help optimize training programs for athletes and fitness enthusiasts.</li><li><strong>Experimental Design and Participants:</strong> Fifty-five resistance-trained men were divided into three groups: a control group (CON) maintaining their usual training volume, a group increasing volume by 30% (G30), and a group increasing volume by 60% (G60).  The participants followed a lower-body resistance training program twice a week for eight weeks.  Think of it like giving different amounts of &quot;plant food&quot; (training volume) to three groups of plants (participants) to see how they grow (muscle adaptations).  This controlled approach allowed the researchers to isolate the effects of volume changes.</li><li><strong>Outcome Measures:</strong> Muscle hypertrophy, strength, and strength-endurance were assessed before and after the training period.  Muscle hypertrophy was measured using imaging techniques to see how much the muscles grew, like measuring the diameter of a balloon as it&#x27;s inflated. Strength was measured by the maximum weight lifted in one repetition (1RM), like testing how much a crane can lift. Strength-endurance was measured by repetitions to failure at 70% of 1RM, like seeing how many times a weightlifter can lift a certain weight before getting tired.  These measures provided a comprehensive assessment of the training program&#x27;s effects.</li><li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Both regional fat-free mass (ROI-FFM) and muscle thickness (MT) increased significantly in all groups.  All groups also showed increases in back squat 1RM.  However, the CON group had the highest overall 1RM, while the G30 group showed the greatest improvement in repetitions to failure (RTF).  This is like finding that giving a moderate amount of water to a plant leads to the best overall growth, while slightly more water leads to better endurance but not necessarily more growth.</li><li><strong>Conclusions and Implications:</strong> The findings suggest that maintaining a moderate resistance training volume can lead to significant muscle growth and strength gains in trained individuals.  Increasing the volume beyond a certain threshold may not provide additional benefits for muscle growth and could even hinder strength gains.  A 30% increase in volume might improve strength-endurance, but further research is needed to confirm this.  This is like finding that there&#x27;s a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for watering a plant - too little or too much can be detrimental.</li>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Defining RT Volume and its Importance:</strong> The introduction begins by defining resistance training (RT) volume as the number of sets performed per week, a crucial factor influencing muscle size and strength gains.  It&#x27;s like the amount of water you give a plant - too little, and it won&#x27;t grow; too much, and it might drown.  The introduction then highlights the ongoing scientific interest in the dose-response relationship between RT volume and muscle adaptations, particularly in resistance-trained individuals.  This is important because understanding this relationship can help optimize training programs for experienced athletes and fitness enthusiasts.</li><li><strong>Review of Literature and Identifying a Research Gap:</strong> The introduction presents a review of existing literature on the effects of different RT volumes on muscle hypertrophy in trained individuals.  It notes conflicting findings, with some studies showing no difference between low, moderate, and high weekly set numbers, while others suggest that higher volumes lead to greater muscle growth.  It&#x27;s like some plants thriving with less water while others need more.  The introduction also points out a crucial flaw in many previous studies: the disregard for participants&#x27; previous RT volume and the prescription of absolute RT volume instead.  This is like giving all plants the same amount of water without considering their individual needs or previous watering schedules.</li><li><strong>Importance of Considering Previous Training Volume:</strong> The introduction argues that considering previous training volume is essential for accurately understanding the relationship between RT volume and muscle adaptations.  It explains that previous training volume can act as a moderator, influencing how individuals respond to changes in volume.  It&#x27;s like how a plant that&#x27;s already been well-watered might not need as much additional water as one that&#x27;s been dry.  The introduction emphasizes that accounting for previous RT volume allows for standardized incremental changes and ensures consistency across experimental groups.  This is like adjusting the watering schedule for each plant based on its current hydration level to ensure they all receive the appropriate amount of water.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Previous Research:</strong> The introduction discusses how ignoring previous training volume can lead to biased outcomes due to sudden and uncontrolled changes in volume during the experimental period.  It&#x27;s like suddenly changing a plant&#x27;s watering schedule without considering its previous watering history, which could shock the plant.  The introduction then highlights the scarcity of studies that have accounted for participants&#x27; previous RT volume, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.  This highlights the novelty and importance of the current study.</li><li><strong>Rationale and Hypotheses of the Current Study:</strong> The introduction presents the rationale and hypotheses of the current study, which investigates the effects of two individualized RT volume increases (30% and 60%) based on prior weekly set number on lower-body muscle strength, muscle thickness, and regional fat-free mass accretion in resistance-trained individuals.  It&#x27;s like giving different groups of plants varying amounts of water based on their previous watering schedules and observing their growth.  The study also includes a control group that maintains their weekly sets.  This controlled approach allows researchers to isolate the effects of the volume increases.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear definition of key terms and concepts</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context and importance of resistance training volume for muscle growth and strength adaptations. It clearly defines the key terms and concepts used in the study, such as RT volume and the dose-response relationship. This clarity ensures that readers have a shared understanding of the research focus.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Resistance training (RT) volume, herein operationally defined as the number of sets performed per week, seems to be a crucial variable for eliciting increases in muscle size and strength adaptations (1-6)." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explicitly state the research gap</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to strengthen the introduction by providing a more focused and explicit research gap and hypothesis. While the introduction discusses previous research and highlights conflicting findings, it does not explicitly state the specific gap that this study aims to address. Clearly articulating the research gap would enhance the rationale for the current study and highlight its novel contribution.  A more focused research gap would strengthen the introduction by providing a clear justification for the study&#x27;s design and methodology.  It would also help readers understand the specific contribution of this research to the existing literature.  Explicitly stating the research gap would improve the introduction by providing a more compelling rationale for the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To address the lacunae in the current literature, this study investigated the effects of two individualized RT volume increases" (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a distinct paragraph after the literature review that explicitly states the unanswered question or research gap being addressed. For example: &quot;Despite the existing research on RT volume, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the optimal approach to individualizing volume increases for trained individuals.  Specifically, it remains unclear how different percentage increases in previous training volume affect muscle growth and strength adaptations in this population.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Present hypotheses as a numbered list</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the introduction by providing a more concise and focused hypothesis statement. While the introduction mentions the study&#x27;s hypotheses, they are embedded within a paragraph and not clearly separated. Presenting the hypotheses as a distinct, numbered list would improve their clarity and emphasis.  A more structured presentation of the hypotheses would strengthen the introduction by making the study&#x27;s aims more explicit and testable.  This would also enhance the overall clarity and organization of the introduction, making it easier for readers to understand the study&#x27;s objectives.  Ultimately, a concise and focused hypothesis statement would significantly improve the introduction by making the study&#x27;s aims more prominent and accessible to readers.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Considering the studies cited, which suggest that increasing previous training volume in the experimental period might enhance strength and hypertrophic adaptations, we hypothesized that a) individualized volume increases" (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Present the hypotheses as a separate, numbered list after stating the research gap. For example:&quot;Therefore, we hypothesized that:
1. Individualized volume increases of 30% and 60% would enhance regional-of-interest fat-free mass accretion and muscle thickness adaptations compared to the control group.
2. The 30% individualized increase would elicit superior maximum strength adaptation.
3. The 60% increase would elicit superior strength-endurance adaptations.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Material &amp; Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Design:</strong> The study used a parallel-group repeated-measures design.  This is like setting up multiple conveyor belts (groups) running side-by-side, each carrying different amounts of a product (training volume).  The researchers measured the product&#x27;s quality (muscle adaptations) at various points along the belt (time points).  This design allows for comparisons between groups over time.</li><li><strong>Participant Allocation:</strong> Participants were allocated to three groups based on quadriceps muscle thickness and previous weekly set volume: a control group (CON) maintaining their current volume, and two experimental groups increasing volume by 30% (G30) or 60% (G60). This is like dividing plants into groups based on their size and how much water they usually get.  Some plants (CON) get the same amount of water, while others (G30 and G60) get more.  This approach allows for a controlled comparison of different volume increases.</li><li><strong>ROI-FFM Assessment:</strong> A Lunar Prodigy dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) apparatus was used to measure regional fat-free mass (ROI-FFM).  DEXA uses low-dose X-rays to differentiate between bone, fat, and lean tissue, much like shining different colored lights through a prism to separate the colors of the rainbow. This provides a precise measurement of muscle mass in the region of interest.</li><li><strong>Muscle Thickness Assessment:</strong> B-mode ultrasound was used to measure anterior thigh muscle thickness (MT) at proximal (PMT) and distal (DMT) sites. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of internal structures, like using sonar to map the ocean floor.  This allows for non-invasive measurement of muscle thickness at specific locations.</li><li><strong>Maximum Strength Assessment:</strong> Maximum strength was assessed using the one-repetition maximum (1RM) test on the barbell back squat. The 1RM is the maximum weight a person can lift for one repetition, like finding the maximum weight a bridge can support.  This is a standard measure of maximal strength.</li><li><strong>Strength-Endurance Assessment:</strong> Strength-endurance was assessed using repetitions-to-failure (RTF) at 70% of 1RM on the back squat. RTF is the maximum number of repetitions a person can perform at a given weight until they can no longer maintain proper form, like measuring how many times a car can go around a track before running out of fuel.  This measures the ability to sustain muscular effort.</li><li><strong>Training Intervention:</strong> Participants underwent an 8-week hypertrophy-oriented lower-limb RT program performed twice per week. The program included squats, leg presses, and leg extensions for the quadriceps, and Romanian deadlifts and glute-ham raises for the posterior chain. This is like giving plants a specific type and amount of fertilizer over a set period.  The researchers controlled the training program to ensure consistency across participants.</li><li><strong>Perceptual Assessments:</strong> Perceived recovery (PRS) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were assessed using validated scales. PRS measures how recovered participants feel before each training session, like checking the battery level of a phone. RPE measures how strenuous the exercise feels, like measuring the temperature of a room. These subjective measures provide insights into training load and recovery.</li><li><strong>Blinding Procedures:</strong> Blinding procedures were implemented for data acquisition and analysis of ultrasound and ROI measurements to reduce potential bias.  This is like having judges in a competition taste food without knowing who cooked it. Blinding ensures objectivity in data collection and interpretation.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analyses:</strong> Statistical analyses included mixed-model analyses for dependent variables, with group and time as fixed factors and subject as a random factor. This is like using a statistical microscope to examine the effects of different training volumes on muscle adaptations.  Mixed models account for individual variability and allow for analysis of repeated measures data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear study design</strong>
        <p>The methods section clearly defines the study&#x27;s design as a parallel-group repeated-measures design with counterbalanced randomization. This is a strength as it enhances the internal validity of the study by controlling for potential confounding variables and ensuring that the groups are comparable at baseline.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This study employed a parallel-group repeated-measures design, with a counterbalanced randomization." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specific participant criteria</strong>
        <p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants are well-defined, ensuring the selection of a homogenous sample of resistance-trained males. This strengthens the study&#x27;s internal validity and allows for more precise conclusions about the effects of the intervention on the target population.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The inclusion criteria were as follows: males aged 18-40 years; at least three years of previous RT experience and relative barbell back squat strength of at least 1.5 times their body mass." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed data collection procedures</strong>
        <p>The procedures for data collection are described in detail, including specific equipment, measurement protocols, and timing of assessments. This level of detail strengthens the study&#x27;s reproducibility, allowing other researchers to replicate the methods and verify the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Anterior thigh MT was measured using B-mode ultrasound (HS40; Samsung Healthcare, Ridgefield Park, NJ) with a linear probe (LA3-16AD, Samsung Healthcare) with frequency ranges between 8.0 and 12.0 Mhz." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Justify initial sample size target</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the methodological rigor and transparency of the study by providing a rationale for the chosen sample size. While the section mentions a post-hoc power analysis, it lacks a clear justification for the initial recruitment target.  The Materials &amp; Methods section needs this justification to address potential concerns about underpowering and to provide context for the post-hoc analysis. Adding a rationale for the initial sample size target, even if it was not based on a formal a priori power analysis, would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a thoughtful approach to study design and increasing confidence in the reported findings.  It would also address potential reviewer concerns about the study&#x27;s power and generalizability.  Ultimately, providing this rationale would significantly improve the study&#x27;s methodological rigor by ensuring transparency and justifying the chosen sample size.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Considering the training status of our population and the small effects observed in trained cohorts, we did not calculate an a priori power analysis." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a statement explaining the rationale for the initial sample size target.  For example: &quot;Due to the exploratory nature of the study and the limited available data on the effects of individualized volume increases in trained individuals, a formal a priori power analysis was not conducted.  However, a sample size of 55 participants was initially targeted based on previous research in similar populations and feasibility considerations.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain exercise selection rationale</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to improve the clarity and reproducibility of the training intervention description by providing more details about the exercise selection rationale. While the section lists the exercises used, it doesn&#x27;t explain why these specific exercises were chosen.  The Materials &amp; Methods section needs this information to allow other researchers to understand the rationale behind the training program and potentially replicate it. Providing a rationale for the exercise selection would strengthen the paper by enhancing the transparency of the training intervention and allowing for better comparisons with other studies.  It would also help readers understand the specific muscle groups targeted and the overall training stimulus applied.  Ultimately, including this rationale would improve the study&#x27;s methodological rigor and facilitate future research in this area.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants trained twice a week for 8 weeks (i.e., 16 sessions) on the squat, leg press, and leg extension exercises." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining the rationale for choosing the squat, leg press, and leg extension exercises.  For example: &quot;These exercises were selected to target the quadriceps muscle group comprehensively, incorporating compound and isolation movements with varying biomechanical demands.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify volume load for posterior chain</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the study by providing more detail about the volume load calculations for the posterior chain exercises.  While the section mentions that volume load was calculated and presented only for quadriceps exercises, it lacks specific details about how the volume load for the posterior chain exercises was handled.  The Methods section needs this clarification to ensure transparency and allow for a complete understanding of the training protocol. Providing more details about the volume load calculations for the posterior chain exercises, even if they are not presented in the results, would strengthen the paper by ensuring methodological transparency and enabling other researchers to replicate the study more accurately.  It would also address potential questions about the overall training stimulus applied to the posterior chain muscles.  Ultimately, clarifying this aspect would improve the study&#x27;s methodological rigor and reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, volume load has been calculated and only presented for the exercises targeting the quadriceps exclusively." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining how the volume load for the Romanian deadlifts and glute-ham raises was calculated and whether it was included in any analyses. For example: &quot;Volume load for Romanian deadlifts and glute-ham raises was calculated similarly to the quadriceps exercises but was not included in the primary analyses to maintain the focus on the quadriceps muscle group.&quot;</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of a CONSORT Flow Diagram</strong>: A CONSORT flow diagram is a visual tool used in scientific research, particularly in clinical trials, to show the flow of participants through a study. CONSORT stands for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials. Think of it like a map that tracks the journey of each participant from the beginning to the end of the research.</li><li><strong>Stages of Participant Flow</strong>: The diagram typically starts with the total number of individuals assessed for eligibility. It then shows how this initial group is narrowed down based on specific criteria, like a funnel. Some people might not meet the study&#x27;s requirements (exclusion criteria), and this is clearly indicated. The remaining participants are then randomly assigned (randomization) into different groups, such as treatment and control groups.</li><li><strong>Tracking Participant Progress</strong>: As the study progresses, the diagram tracks what happens to each group. It shows how many participants complete each phase of the study and how many drop out, along with the reasons for their withdrawal. This part is crucial for understanding the study&#x27;s retention rate and potential biases that could arise if many participants leave.</li><li><strong>Final Analysis</strong>: Finally, the diagram indicates the number of participants included in the final analysis for each group. This helps readers see how the data was analyzed and whether the analysis included all participants or only those who completed the study. In this specific diagram, it indicates that there are different types of analyses done, specifically Mixed Model analysis and ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) analysis. Mixed Model analysis is a statistical method that handles missing data points. ANCOVA analysis is a method that assesses the differences between groups while controlling for other variables that might influence the outcome.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Adherence to CONSORT Guidelines</strong>: The CONSORT flow diagram appears to adhere to the standard CONSORT guidelines, providing a clear and transparent account of participant progression throughout the study. The inclusion of specific numbers at each stage (enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis) is consistent with best practices for reporting clinical trials and enhances the study&#x27;s reproducibility.</li><li><strong>Detailed Accounting of Participant Attrition</strong>: The diagram provides a detailed account of participant attrition, including reasons for dropouts. This level of detail is crucial for assessing potential biases. For instance, a high dropout rate in one group or for a specific reason (e.g., injury related to the study) could impact the study&#x27;s internal validity. The diagram allows readers to evaluate these factors effectively.</li><li><strong>Transparency in Group Allocation and Analysis</strong>: The diagram clearly shows the number of participants allocated to each group (CON, G30, G60) and specifies the number of participants included in each type of analysis (Mixed Model and ANCOVA). This transparency is important for understanding the statistical power of each analysis and for assessing the generalizability of the findings.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity and Readability</strong>: The flow diagram is well-organized and easy to follow. The use of distinct boxes and arrows clearly delineates the flow of participants through the study. The color-coding of different stages (e.g., Enrollment in blue) further enhances readability. It effectively communicates the complex process of participant flow in a concise and understandable manner.</li><li><strong>Use of Text Labels</strong>: The text labels within each box are concise and informative. They provide sufficient detail to understand each stage without being overly verbose. However, the label &quot;COVID-19 restrictions&quot; could benefit from a slightly more detailed explanation, as the specific nature of these restrictions is not immediately clear.</li><li><strong>Visual Appeal and Simplicity</strong>: The diagram maintains a simple and uncluttered design, which aids in its visual appeal and ease of interpretation. The use of a single color scheme for each group throughout the diagram is consistent and helps to visually distinguish the groups. Overall, the diagram is effective in conveying key information about the study&#x27;s methodology in a visually engaging manner.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview of Presented Images</strong>: This figure shows how the researchers measured body composition, specifically fat-free mass and muscle thickness in the thigh. It&#x27;s like taking a detailed look inside the body to see what&#x27;s under the skin, focusing on muscle and excluding fat. The figure is divided into three parts (A, B, and C) to illustrate different measurement techniques.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Image 2A</strong>: Image 2A shows an X-ray-like picture, which is a scan of the lower body. This is a visual representation of a technique called dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which is like a sophisticated scale that can differentiate between bone, fat, and lean tissue (muscle). The &#x27;region-of-interest fat-free mass&#x27; (ROI-FFM) refers to the amount of muscle in a specific area, in this case, from the top of the hip bone (iliac crest) down to the outer side of the knee (lateral condyle). Imagine drawing a box on the body from the hip to the knee and measuring only the muscle within that box, excluding everything else.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Images 2B and 2C</strong>: Images 2B and 2C are ultrasound images showing the thickness of the thigh muscles. Ultrasound is like using sound waves to &#x27;see&#x27; inside the body, similar to how bats use echolocation. Image B shows the &#x27;proximal muscle thickness,&#x27; which is the muscle thickness closer to the hip, while Image C shows the &#x27;distal muscle thickness,&#x27; which is the muscle thickness closer to the knee. The labels &#x27;RF&#x27; and &#x27;VI&#x27; point out two specific muscles: the Rectus Femoris, which is the large muscle at the front of the thigh that helps extend the knee, and the Vastus Intermedius, which lies beneath the Rectus Femoris and also assists in knee extension.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Appropriateness of Measurement Techniques</strong>: The use of DEXA for assessing ROI-FFM and ultrasound for measuring muscle thickness are both well-established and valid methods in exercise science. DEXA is considered a gold standard for body composition analysis, and ultrasound provides a reliable, non-invasive way to measure muscle dimensions. The combination of these techniques provides a comprehensive assessment of both overall lean mass and specific muscle size changes.</li><li><strong>Specificity of Anatomical Landmarks</strong>: The description clearly defines the anatomical landmarks used for the measurements (iliac crest to lateral condyle for DEXA, and proximal and distal portions of the thigh for ultrasound). This specificity is crucial for ensuring consistency and reproducibility of the measurements. The reference to established anatomical landmarks enhances the scientific rigor of the study.</li><li><strong>Relevance to Study Objectives</strong>: The measurements depicted in Figure 2 are directly relevant to the study&#x27;s objectives of assessing muscle hypertrophy and body composition changes. By visualizing these specific measurements, the figure helps to establish the link between the intervention (resistance training) and the measured outcomes (changes in muscle size and fat-free mass).</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity of Image Labeling</strong>: The images are clearly labeled, with distinct panels (A, B, C) and clear indications of the anatomical structures being measured (RF, VI, Femur). The use of arrows and labels within the images helps to guide the reader&#x27;s attention to the relevant features. However, the specific measurement lines in images B and C could be more prominent to clearly show where the thickness is being measured.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness of Caption</strong>: The caption effectively describes the content of the figure, providing a brief overview of each panel. The abbreviations (ROI-FFM, RF, VI) are defined, which is essential for readers unfamiliar with these terms. The caption could be slightly improved by explicitly stating that image A represents a DEXA scan, as this is not immediately obvious from the image alone.</li><li><strong>Visual Quality of Images</strong>: The quality of the images is generally good, particularly the ultrasound images (B and C), which provide clear visualization of the muscle tissue. The DEXA scan image (A) is less visually striking but still adequate for illustrating the region of interest. The contrast in the ultrasound images could be slightly enhanced to better differentiate between the muscle and surrounding tissues.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose of the Table</strong>: This table summarizes the characteristics of the people who participated in the study, specifically those who completed the initial testing. Think of it like a snapshot of the group&#x27;s starting conditions before the experiment began. It provides information about the participants in each of the three groups: CON, G30, and G60.</li><li><strong>Information Presented</strong>: The table lists several characteristics for each group, including the number of participants (N), average body mass (in kilograms), average age (in years), average body fat percentage (BF%), average previous set number per week (PSN), average weekly set number performed during the study (SPS), the average number of sets added to PSN for the intervention protocol (SET_DIFF), and the average squat 1RM:BM (a ratio of the maximum weight they could squat for one repetition to their body mass). These are all factors that could potentially influence the results of the study.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Terms</strong>: BF% is a measure of how much of a person&#x27;s body weight is made up of fat. PSN (Previous Set Number) is the number of sets of exercises they were doing each week before the study. SPS (Study Set Number) is the number of sets they did each week during the study. SET_DIFF is the difference between the number of sets they did before the study and the number they did during the study. Squat 1RM:BM is a measure of their strength relative to their body weight. For example, if someone can squat 100 kg and they weigh 50 kg, their Squat 1RM:BM would be 2.0.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevance to Study Design</strong>: Presenting baseline characteristics is crucial for demonstrating the initial equivalence (or lack thereof) of the experimental groups. This is important for establishing the internal validity of the study, as any pre-existing differences between groups could confound the results. By comparing the baseline characteristics, readers can assess whether any observed effects are likely due to the intervention or to pre-existing differences between the groups.</li><li><strong>Completeness of Data</strong>: The table appears to present data for all participants who completed baseline testing (N=55), which is consistent with the reference text. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that the reference text also mentions that only 29 participants completed the entire study. This discrepancy in the number of participants who completed baseline testing versus the entire study should be clarified and its implications for the generalizability of the findings should be discussed.</li><li><strong>Appropriateness of Variables</strong>: The variables included in the table are relevant to the study&#x27;s aims and are commonly reported in exercise science research. They provide a comprehensive overview of the participants&#x27; physical characteristics and training history. However, it might be beneficial to include additional variables, such as training experience (e.g., years of resistance training), to further characterize the sample.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: While the table itself does not present statistical analyses, it is implied that these characteristics were compared between groups to assess baseline equivalence. The methods section should clearly describe the statistical tests used for these comparisons (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests). Reporting the p-values for these comparisons in the table would further enhance its scientific value.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity of Column Headers</strong>: The column headers are clear and concise, providing a brief description of each variable. The use of abbreviations (e.g., BF%, PSN, SPS) is appropriate given the space constraints of a table, and these abbreviations are defined in the footnote. However, the header &quot;SET_DIFF (Sets.week¹)&quot; could be improved by providing a more descriptive label, such as &quot;Change in Weekly Sets.&quot;</li><li><strong>Organization and Readability</strong>: The table is well-organized and easy to read. The use of distinct rows for each variable and columns for each group allows for a clear comparison of characteristics. The table is not overly cluttered, and the information is presented in a logical order. The use of bold font for the group names (CON, G30, G60) enhances readability.</li><li><strong>Footnote Clarity</strong>: The footnote provides clear definitions for the abbreviations used in the table. However, the definition of SET_DIFF could be made more explicit by stating that it represents the difference between SPS and PSN. Additionally, the footnote could be improved by briefly explaining the relevance of each variable to the study&#x27;s aims.</li><li><strong>Overall Effectiveness</strong>: The table effectively communicates the baseline characteristics of the participants in each group. It provides a concise summary of the key variables that could potentially influence the study&#x27;s results. The table is well-designed and easy to understand, making it an effective tool for conveying this important information.</li></ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>ROI-FFM Changes:</strong> All groups experienced increases in ROI-FFM, indicating muscle growth in the thigh region. This is like measuring the increase in the size of a balloon (thigh) as it&#x27;s filled with air (muscle).  The lack of a group or interaction effect suggests that the different training volumes did not differentially affect overall muscle growth in this region.</li><li><strong>Muscle Thickness Changes:</strong> Similar to ROI-FFM, all groups experienced increases in muscle thickness (MT) at both proximal and distal sites, further confirming muscle growth. This is like measuring the thickness of a tree trunk (muscle) at different heights (proximal and distal). The absence of group or interaction effects indicates that the different training volumes did not lead to site-specific differences in muscle growth.</li><li><strong>1RM Changes:</strong> While all groups increased their 1RM back squat strength, the CON group showed the highest overall 1RM. This is like three different weightlifters (groups) all lifting heavier weights (increased 1RM) after training, but one weightlifter (CON) lifting the heaviest weight overall. This unexpected finding suggests that increasing training volume may not be beneficial for maximizing strength gains in already trained individuals.</li><li><strong>RTF Changes:</strong> Only the G30 group showed a significant increase in repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% of 1RM. This is like a marathon runner (G30) being able to run farther (increased RTF) at the same pace (70% 1RM) after training, while other runners (CON and G60) don&#x27;t improve as much. This suggests that a moderate increase in training volume (30%) might be beneficial for improving strength-endurance.</li><li><strong>Perceptual Assessments:</strong> Perceived exertion (RPE) increased over time, indicating that the training sessions felt harder as the study progressed. This is like feeling hotter (increased RPE) as the temperature (training intensity) rises.  However, there were no differences between groups, suggesting that the perceived difficulty of training was similar across different training volumes.</li><li><strong>Volume Load Confirmation:</strong> The lack of significant differences in volume load between groups confirms that the individualized volume increases were implemented as intended.  This is like ensuring that each plant (group) receives the correct amount of water (volume load) according to the prescribed watering schedule (individualized volume increase).  This is important for ensuring the internal validity of the study.</li>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Report effect sizes for all outcomes</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the clarity and interpretability of the results by providing effect sizes for all outcome measures. While the section reports p-values and confidence intervals, it lacks effect sizes, which are crucial for understanding the magnitude of the observed effects.  The Results section needs effect sizes to allow readers to assess the practical significance of the findings and compare them with other studies. Adding effect sizes would strengthen the paper by providing a more complete picture of the intervention&#x27;s impact and facilitating meta-analyses.  This would enhance the study&#x27;s contribution to the field and improve the overall quality of the results.  Ultimately, reporting effect sizes is essential for enhancing the interpretability and practical relevance of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, no group (p&gt;0.05) or group by time interaction (p&gt;0.05) was observed" (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Calculate and report appropriate effect sizes (e.g., Cohen&#x27;s d, eta squared) for all outcome measures, including ROI-FFM, muscle thickness, 1RM, and RTF. Include these effect sizes in the tables and/or text describing the results.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain statistical findings in context</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to improve the clarity and interpretability of the results by providing a more detailed explanation of the statistical findings. While the section reports the main effects and interactions, it lacks a clear explanation of what these findings mean in the context of the study&#x27;s hypotheses.  The Results section needs a more interpretive approach to help readers understand the implications of the statistical analyses.  Explaining the findings in plain language and connecting them back to the hypotheses would strengthen the paper by making the results more accessible and meaningful to a wider audience.  It would also enhance the overall clarity and impact of the results section.  Ultimately, providing a more detailed explanation of the statistical findings would significantly improve the study&#x27;s clarity and facilitate a deeper understanding of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For ROI-FFM, the mixed model analysis revealed a main time effect (&lt;0.0001)" (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each significant main effect or interaction, provide a brief explanation of what it means in the context of the study. For example, for the main time effect for ROI-FFM, state: &quot;This indicates that ROI-FFM increased significantly from pre- to post-training in all groups.&quot;  Connect these explanations back to the original hypotheses. For example: &quot;This finding supports our first hypothesis that individualized volume increases would enhance ROI-FFM accretion.&quot;</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>What the Graph Represents</strong>: This graph shows the average weekly &quot;volume load&quot; for three different groups of people doing exercises over 16 sessions. Imagine you&#x27;re lifting weights; the volume load is a way to measure how much total work you&#x27;ve done. It&#x27;s calculated by multiplying the weight you lift by the number of times you lift it (repetitions) and the number of sets you do. So, if you lift 10 kg for 3 sets of 10 repetitions each, your volume load for that exercise would be 10 kg x 3 sets x 10 reps = 300 kg. This graph tracks this total work done each week for each group.</li><li><strong>Description of the Groups</strong>: There are three groups represented by different colored lines: blue for the control group (CON), orange for the group with a 30% increase in the number of sets (G30), and green for the group with a 60% increase in the number of sets (G60). The control group is like a baseline; they&#x27;re doing their usual routine. The other two groups are doing more sets than they normally would, with G60 doing the most extra work. &#x27;Sets&#x27; here refers to the number of times a group of repetitions is performed. For example, doing 10 push-ups, resting, and then doing another 10 push-ups means you did 2 sets of push-ups.</li><li><strong>How the Data is Displayed</strong>: The graph has &#x27;Volume Load (kg)&#x27; on the vertical axis (the up-and-down line) and &#x27;Session&#x27; on the horizontal axis (the side-to-side line). Each point on the lines represents the average volume load for that group at that particular session. The shaded areas around the lines are likely showing the variability or spread of the data, like a range of how much volume load different people in the same group did. This helps us see not just the average, but also how much individual results differed within each group.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevance to Study&#x27;s Aim</strong>: This figure directly addresses the study&#x27;s aim of investigating the effects of different training volumes. By plotting the average weekly volume load, it provides a clear comparison of the training stimulus experienced by each group. This is crucial for understanding the relationship between training volume and the observed outcomes (muscle growth, strength, etc.). The validity of using volume load as a measure of training stimulus is well-established in the field of exercise science.</li><li><strong>Accuracy of Representation</strong>: The figure accurately represents the intended data, as described in the caption and methods. The use of separate lines for each group allows for a direct visual comparison of their training volumes. The inclusion of error bars or shaded areas to represent variability (e.g., standard deviation or confidence intervals) enhances the scientific rigor by providing information about the precision of the estimates.</li><li><strong>Limitations in Generalizability</strong>: While the figure provides valuable information about the volume load within the study, it&#x27;s important to note that these values are specific to the exercises and protocols used. Generalizing these absolute volume load numbers to other exercises or training programs should be done with caution, as different exercises and populations may have different volume-load responses.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity of Group Differentiation</strong>: The use of distinct colors (blue, orange, green) for each group makes it easy to distinguish between them. The legend clearly identifies which color corresponds to each group (CON, G30, G60), enhancing the readability of the graph. The labels are concise and informative, accurately describing the experimental manipulation (e.g., &quot;30% increase in the number of sets&quot;).</li><li><strong>Effectiveness of Axis Labels</strong>: The axis labels are clear and informative. &quot;Volume Load (kg)&quot; on the y-axis provides a precise definition of the measured variable, including the unit of measurement. &quot;Session&quot; on the x-axis clearly indicates the time points at which the measurements were taken. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis across all groups allows for a direct visual comparison of volume load between groups.</li><li><strong>Use of Shaded Areas</strong>: The shaded areas around the lines, likely representing the standard deviation or confidence intervals, are visually effective in conveying the variability within each group. However, the exact meaning of the shaded areas should be explicitly stated in the caption or figure legend to avoid ambiguity. The overlapping shaded areas also provide a visual indication of the degree of overlap between groups, which is helpful in interpreting the statistical significance of any observed differences.</li><li><strong>Overall Visual Appeal</strong>: The graph is visually appealing and easy to understand. The use of a simple line graph format, distinct colors, and clear labels makes it effective in communicating the key findings. The graph is not overly cluttered, and the information is presented in a logical and intuitive manner. The overall design of the graph contributes to its effectiveness in conveying the intended message.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>What the Graph Shows</strong>: This graph is a scatterplot, which means it uses dots to represent data points. Each dot shows the change in two measurements for a single participant: how much their muscle thickness changed and how much their fat-free mass in a specific region (region-of-interest fat-free mass) changed. Think of it like plotting each person&#x27;s muscle growth against their lean mass gains on a graph. &#x27;Delta-change&#x27; simply means the amount of change from the beginning to the end of the study.</li><li><strong>Explanation of the Axes</strong>: The horizontal axis (the side-to-side line) represents the change in region-of-interest fat-free mass (measured in grams), which is essentially the change in lean mass in a specific area of the body. The vertical axis (the up-and-down line) represents the change in muscle thickness (measured in centimeters). So, each dot&#x27;s position tells you how much a person&#x27;s lean mass and muscle thickness changed.</li><li><strong>Meaning of the Marker Size</strong>: The size of each dot (or &#x27;marker&#x27;) represents the participant&#x27;s volume load. As explained before, volume load is a measure of the total work done during exercise (weight x reps x sets). A bigger dot means a higher volume load, so participants who lifted more weight, did more repetitions, or completed more sets have larger dots. This allows us to see if there&#x27;s a relationship between the amount of work done and the changes in muscle thickness and lean mass.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Density Plots</strong>: The shaded areas along the edges of the graph are called density plots. They show the distribution of the data for each axis. Imagine you&#x27;re looking at a mountain range from the side; the density plot is like a silhouette of that mountain, showing where most of the data points are clustered. A taller peak in the density plot means that many participants had similar changes in that measurement. This helps us see the overall trends in the data, like whether most people gained a lot of muscle thickness or just a little.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Visualization of Individual Variability</strong>: This figure is valuable because it shows individual data points rather than just group averages. This allows for the assessment of individual variability in response to the training interventions. By plotting each participant&#x27;s change in muscle thickness against their change in fat-free mass, the figure helps to reveal potential relationships between these variables and how they might be influenced by training volume (indicated by marker size).</li><li><strong>Appropriateness of Using a Scatterplot</strong>: A scatterplot is an appropriate choice for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, as is the case here. The addition of marker size to represent a third variable (volume load) is a useful way to incorporate additional information into the plot. However, the scientific validity of this approach depends on the assumption that volume load is linearly or monotonically related to the marker size, which should be clearly stated.</li><li><strong>Use of Density Plots</strong>: The inclusion of density plots along the axes enhances the figure&#x27;s scientific value by providing information about the distribution of each variable. This allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the data, beyond simply looking at the scatterplot alone. For example, the density plots can reveal whether the data are normally distributed, skewed, or bimodal, which can have implications for the statistical analyses and interpretation of the results. However, it is important to note that the shape of the density plot is affected by the choice of bandwidth. The chosen bandwidth should be justified in the methods or figure caption.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Clarity of the Caption</strong>: The caption is generally clear and informative, providing a concise description of the figure&#x27;s content. It explains the meaning of the axes, the marker size, and the density plots. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the units of measurement for each axis (grams for fat-free mass and centimeters for muscle thickness) and by providing a brief interpretation of the expected relationship between the variables.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness of Color and Marker Size</strong>: The use of different colors to represent the three experimental groups (CON, G30, G60) is effective in visually distinguishing the groups. However, the color scheme could be improved by using more contrasting colors to enhance readability. The use of marker size to represent volume load is visually intuitive, with larger markers indicating higher volume loads. However, the exact relationship between volume load and marker size should be specified in the caption (e.g., linear, logarithmic) to aid in interpretation.</li><li><strong>Density Plot Presentation</strong>: The density plots are well-integrated into the figure and provide valuable information about the distribution of the data. However, they could be made more prominent by using a darker shade or a thicker line. Additionally, the y-axis label for the density plot (&quot;Density&quot;) is missing, which could cause confusion for some readers. It is also worth considering whether separate density plots for each experimental group would enhance the figure&#x27;s interpretability, especially if the groups exhibit distinct distributions.</li><li><strong>Overall Visual Appeal</strong>: The scatterplot is generally well-designed and visually appealing. The use of a clean, uncluttered layout, clear axis labels, and a legend for the experimental groups makes the figure easy to understand. The inclusion of a diagonal line representing the overall trend (r = 0.71) is helpful in visualizing the relationship between the two main variables. However, the figure could be further improved by adding gridlines to facilitate the reading of specific data points and by increasing the font size of the axis labels and legend to enhance readability.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>What the Graph Shows</strong>: This graph is a scatterplot, similar to Figure 4. Each dot represents one participant in the study. The position of each dot shows how much that participant&#x27;s one-repetition maximum (1RM) and their repetitions-to-failure changed over the course of the study. &#x27;1RM&#x27; stands for one-repetition maximum, which is the heaviest weight a person can lift for one repetition of an exercise. &#x27;Repetitions-to-failure&#x27; means the number of times someone can do an exercise before they can&#x27;t do it anymore. &#x27;Delta change&#x27; means the amount of change from the beginning to the end of the study. In this graph, we are looking at changes in strength.</li><li><strong>Explanation of the Axes</strong>: The horizontal axis (side-to-side) shows the change in repetitions-to-failure. The vertical axis (up-and-down) shows the change in 1RM, measured in kilograms (kg). So, if a dot is high up on the graph, it means that the participant&#x27;s 1RM increased a lot. If a dot is far to the right, it means that the participant&#x27;s repetitions-to-failure increased a lot.</li><li><strong>Meaning of the Marker Size</strong>: Just like in Figure 4, the size of each dot represents the participant&#x27;s volume load. A bigger dot means the participant did more total work during the study (weight lifted x number of repetitions x number of sets). This helps us see if there&#x27;s a connection between how much work someone did and how much their strength improved.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Density Plots</strong>: The shaded areas along the edges of the graph are density plots. They show where most of the data points are clustered for each measurement (change in 1RM and change in repetitions-to-failure). A taller peak means that many participants had similar changes in that measurement. These density plots help us see the overall trends in the data, like whether most people improved their 1RM a lot or just a little.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose of the Table</strong>: This table presents the results of the measurements of fat-free mass and muscle thickness in specific regions of the body. It compares these measurements between the three groups (CON, G30, and G60) both before (Pre) and after (Post) the intervention. Think of it like showing the &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures of the body composition changes for each group.</li><li><strong>Measurements Presented</strong>: The table shows the average (mean) and the spread of the data (standard deviation, indicated by ± SD) for each measurement. The measurements include region-of-interest fat-free mass (ROI-FFM), which is the amount of lean mass in a specific area, and muscle thickness at two locations: proximal (PMT) and distal (DMT). It also includes the sum of proximal and distal muscle thickness (ΣΜΤ). Imagine measuring the amount of muscle in your arm, the thickness of the muscle near your shoulder (proximal) and near your elbow (distal), and then adding those two thicknesses together.</li><li><strong>Structure of the Table</strong>: The table is organized with the different measurements (ROI-FFM, PMT, DMT, ΣΜΤ) listed in rows and the three groups (CON, G30, G60) listed in columns. For each group, it shows the average measurement before the intervention (Pre) and after the intervention (Post), along with the number of participants (n) in each group for each measurement. This allows us to see how each group changed from the beginning to the end of the study.</li><li><strong>Explanation of 95% CI and ES</strong>: 95% CI refers to the 95% confidence interval. This is a range of values that we are 95% confident contains the true average value for the population. It helps to understand how precise the sample average is. For example, a 95% CI of 0.63 to 1.18 kg means that we are 95% confident that the true average difference between CON vs G30 is between 0.63 kg and 1.18 kg. ES refers to effect size. Effect size is a way to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables. In this table, it is used to quantify the magnitude of the change in each measurement from pre- to post-test.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Relevance to Study Aims</strong>: This table directly addresses the study&#x27;s primary aims of assessing changes in body composition (fat-free mass and muscle thickness) in response to different training volumes. By presenting the pre- and post-intervention measurements for each group, the table allows for a direct comparison of the effects of the different interventions (CON, G30, G60) on these key outcome variables.</li><li><strong>Appropriateness of Statistical Descriptors</strong>: The use of mean ± SD is appropriate for describing the central tendency and variability of the data. The inclusion of the number of participants (n) for each measurement is important for assessing the sample size and potential for statistical power. The inclusion of 95% confidence intervals (CI) and effect sizes (ES) further enhances the scientific rigor by providing information about the precision and magnitude of the observed effects. However, the table only reports the main time effect and does not present the p-values for the group comparisons or the group-by-time interactions. Including these p-values would provide a more complete picture of the statistical significance of the observed changes.</li><li><strong>Consistency with Reference Text</strong>: The reference text provides specific pairwise comparisons for ROI-FFM, which are not included in the table. While the table presents the necessary data to calculate these comparisons, it would be more informative to include the pairwise comparisons (and their corresponding p-values) directly in the table or in a separate table. This would facilitate a more direct assessment of the differences between groups.</li><li><strong>Clarity of Variable Definitions</strong>: The variables (ROI-FFM, PMT, DMT, ΣΜΤ) are clearly defined in the footnote, which enhances the interpretability of the table. However, the footnote could be improved by briefly explaining the rationale for choosing these specific measurements and their relevance to the study&#x27;s aims.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose of the Table</strong>: This table presents the results of the strength tests, specifically looking at maximum strength (how much weight someone can lift once) and strength-endurance (how many times someone can lift a certain weight before getting tired). It compares these measurements between the three groups (CON, G30, and G60) both before (Pre) and after (Post) the intervention. Think of it like showing the &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures of how strong each group became.</li><li><strong>Measurements Presented</strong>: The table shows the average (mean) and the spread of the data (standard deviation, indicated by ± SD) for each measurement. The measurements include 1RM (one-repetition maximum), which is the maximum amount of weight a person can lift for one repetition of an exercise, and RTF (repetitions to failure), which is the number of times a person can lift a certain weight (in this case, 70% of their 1RM) before they can&#x27;t lift it anymore. Imagine testing how much weight you can lift just once, and then testing how many times you can lift a lighter weight before you&#x27;re too tired to lift it again.</li><li><strong>Structure of the Table</strong>: The table is organized with the different measurements (1RM and RTF) listed in rows and the three groups (CON, G30, G60) listed in columns. For each group, it shows the average measurement before the intervention (Pre) and after the intervention (Post), along with the number of participants (n) in each group for each measurement. This allows us to see how each group&#x27;s strength changed from the beginning to the end of the study.</li></ul>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypertrophy Adaptations Not Enhanced by Volume Increases:</strong> The study did not confirm the initial hypothesis that individualizing volume increases would lead to greater muscle hypertrophy than maintaining current volume. All groups experienced similar increases in regional fat-free mass (ROI-FFM) and muscle thickness (MT), regardless of the percentage increase in training volume. This is akin to giving three identical saplings different amounts of fertilizer and finding they all grow the same amount. This finding challenges the assumption that more volume automatically equates to more muscle growth, particularly in trained individuals.</li><li><strong>Control Group Showed Greatest Strength Gains:</strong> Contrary to the hypothesis, the control group (CON), which maintained their existing training volume, demonstrated the greatest overall gains in 1RM back squat strength. While all groups showed strength improvements, the CON group&#x27;s superior performance suggests that increasing volume may not be the most effective strategy for maximizing strength gains in already trained individuals. This is like finding that a car&#x27;s speed doesn&#x27;t increase proportionally with engine size - sometimes, a smaller, more efficient engine can outperform a larger one. This unexpected finding highlights the complex relationship between training volume and strength adaptations.</li><li><strong>Moderate Volume Increase Improved Strength-Endurance:</strong> The G30 group, which increased their training volume by 30%, was the only group to show significant improvements in repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% of 1RM. This indicates a potential benefit of moderate volume increases for enhancing strength-endurance.  This is similar to a long-distance runner increasing their weekly mileage moderately and seeing an improvement in their ability to run longer at a given pace.  This finding suggests that a 30% increase in volume may be optimal for improving the ability to sustain muscular effort over time.</li><li><strong>Perceived Exertion Increased Over Time:</strong> The study found a main effect of time for perceived exertion (RPE), with all groups reporting higher RPE in the second half of the study. This is expected, as training intensity typically increases over time as individuals adapt to the training stimulus. It&#x27;s like gradually increasing the heat on a stove - it feels hotter as the temperature rises.  However, there were no significant differences in RPE between groups, suggesting that the perceived difficulty of training was similar across the different volume conditions.</li><li><strong>Study Limitations Addressed:</strong> The discussion acknowledges several limitations of the study, including the specific population studied (young, resistance-trained males), the short-term nature of the intervention, the lack of nutritional control, and the high dropout rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  These limitations are important to consider when interpreting the results and generalizing the findings to other populations or training contexts. Acknowledging these limitations strengthens the discussion by demonstrating a critical evaluation of the study&#x27;s design and its potential impact on the results.</li><li><strong>Practical Implications for Training:</strong> The discussion concludes by suggesting that maintaining a moderate resistance training volume may be sufficient for muscle growth and strength gains in trained individuals, while excessive increases in volume may not provide additional benefits and could even hinder strength development.  This is analogous to finding the optimal amount of sunlight for a plant - too little hinders growth, but too much can scorch the leaves. This conclusion provides practical implications for resistance training program design and emphasizes the importance of individualizing training volume based on training experience and goals.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Effective summary of main findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings of the study, including the observed changes in muscle hypertrophy, maximal strength, and strength-endurance. This provides a clear overview of the key outcomes and allows readers to quickly grasp the main takeaways.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This study compared the effects of three individualized RT volume increments on lower-body muscular adaptations in resistance-trained individuals." (Page 19)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand analysis of unexpected strength findings</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the discussion by providing a more in-depth analysis of the unexpected findings regarding maximal strength. While the discussion acknowledges the unexpected superior performance of the CON group in 1RM, it lacks a thorough exploration of potential underlying mechanisms. The Discussion section needs to delve deeper into these unexpected results to provide a more nuanced interpretation and stimulate further research. Expanding on this analysis would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a critical evaluation of the results and offering potential explanations for the observed discrepancies. This would enhance the study&#x27;s scientific contribution and provide valuable insights for future research. Ultimately, a more in-depth analysis of the unexpected strength findings would significantly improve the discussion by fostering a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between training volume and strength adaptations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Intriguingly, our findings suggest that maximal back squat strength can be improved with no change in lower-body quadriceps RT volume." (Page 22)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing potential reasons for the CON group&#x27;s superior 1RM gains. Consider factors like the potential for overtraining in the higher volume groups, individual differences in training responsiveness, and the specific training status of the participants.  For example: &quot;The unexpected superior 1RM gains in the CON group warrant further investigation. It is possible that the higher volume groups experienced greater fatigue accumulation or surpassed their maximal recoverable volume, hindering strength gains.  Additionally, the specific training history of the participants, such as their previous exposure to higher volumes, could have influenced their responsiveness to the volume increases.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Compare findings with literature on individualized volume</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to improve the discussion by providing a more thorough comparison of the study&#x27;s findings with the existing literature. While the discussion cites some relevant studies, it lacks a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the current results with previous research on individualized volume increases. The Discussion section needs to provide a more detailed comparison to highlight the study&#x27;s novel contributions and contextualize its findings within the broader literature.  A more thorough comparison would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature and clarifying the study&#x27;s unique contribution.  This would enhance the study&#x27;s impact and facilitate future research. Ultimately, a more detailed comparison with the existing literature would significantly improve the discussion by providing a more nuanced and contextualized interpretation of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Moreover, along with Scarpelli et al. (13), the current study is one of two studies that have utilized resistance-trained participants&#x27; weekly sets before the commencement of the study to prescribe individualized RT volume." (Page 21)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion to include a more systematic comparison of the current results with previous studies on individualized volume increases, specifically focusing on studies that have accounted for participants&#x27; previous training volume.  Discuss similarities and differences in findings, methodological approaches, and participant characteristics.  For example: &quot;Our findings partially align with those of Scarpelli et al. (13), who observed greater hypertrophic adaptations with individualized volume increases. However, unlike their within-subject design, our parallel group design may have limited the precision of our estimates, potentially explaining the lack of significant differences between groups in the current study.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide specific recommendations for future research</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to enhance the discussion by providing more specific and actionable recommendations for future research. While the discussion mentions the need for further research, it lacks concrete and specific directions for future studies. The Discussion section needs to provide clear guidance for future research to build upon the current findings and address remaining questions.  Adding specific recommendations would strengthen the paper by guiding future research efforts and maximizing the impact of the current study.  This would contribute to a more efficient and focused advancement of knowledge in the field.  Ultimately, providing more specific recommendations for future research would significantly improve the discussion by facilitating the development of new research questions and methodologies.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Thus, further research is required to shed light on the intricate relationship between absolute RT volume, progression of RT volume and strength-endurance." (Page 23)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph outlining specific directions for future research.  Include recommendations for study design, participant populations, training interventions, and outcome measures.  For example: &quot;Future research should investigate the effects of individualized volume increases in different populations, such as untrained individuals or women, to determine the generalizability of the current findings.  Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and more frequent assessments are also needed to examine the long-term effects of individualized volume increases on muscle growth and strength adaptations.  Additionally, future studies should explore the potential influence of other training variables, such as exercise selection and training frequency, on the effectiveness of individualized volume approaches.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Specific Population and Training Focus:</strong> The study focuses on lower-body training in young, resistance-trained males, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other populations, such as women or older adults, or to training programs involving other muscle groups. It&#x27;s like studying the effects of a new fertilizer on a specific type of plant - the results might not apply to other plants or growing conditions. This limitation highlights the need for future research to investigate the effects of individualized volume increases in diverse populations and training contexts.</li><li><strong>Range of Previous Training Volume:</strong> The participants&#x27; previous weekly set volume varied from 6 to 48, which restricts the applicability of the findings to individuals with similar training experience. It&#x27;s like testing a new engine in cars that have already been driven different distances - the engine&#x27;s performance might vary depending on the car&#x27;s prior usage. This limitation emphasizes the importance of considering individual training history when designing and interpreting studies on training volume.</li><li><strong>Short-Term Intervention:</strong> The 8-week intervention period is relatively short, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term effects of individualized volume increases on muscle growth and strength. It&#x27;s like observing a plant&#x27;s growth for only a few weeks - you might not see the full effects of the fertilizer over a longer period. This limitation highlights the need for longitudinal studies to examine the sustained effects of individualized volume approaches.</li><li><strong>Lack of Nutritional Control:</strong> The study did not control for nutritional intake, which could have influenced the results. Participants&#x27; protein and calorie intake were not monitored or standardized, introducing a potential confounding variable. It&#x27;s like giving different plants varying amounts of water but not controlling the amount of sunlight they receive - it&#x27;s hard to isolate the effect of watering alone. This limitation emphasizes the importance of controlling for nutritional factors in future research on training volume.</li><li><strong>High Dropout Rate:</strong> The study experienced a substantial dropout rate (approximately 45%) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased data variability and may have introduced selection bias. It&#x27;s like starting a race with a large group of runners but having many drop out along the way - the final results might not accurately reflect the abilities of the original group. This limitation highlights the challenges of conducting research during unforeseen circumstances and the potential impact on data quality and interpretation.</li><li><strong>One-Dimensional Muscle Growth Measure:</strong> The study used ultrasound to measure muscle thickness, which provides only a one-dimensional measure of muscle growth, unlike cross-sectional area (CSA) or volume measurements, which provide two and three-dimensional measures, respectively. It&#x27;s like measuring a tree&#x27;s size by its height alone, ignoring its width and overall volume. This limitation highlights the need for more comprehensive measures of muscle growth in future research.</li><li><strong>Potential Acclimatization Effect:</strong> The strength gains observed in the study might be partially attributed to participants&#x27; acclimatization to the tap-and-go seat used during back squat training, rather than solely to the training intervention itself. It&#x27;s like a basketball player improving their free throw percentage simply by getting used to the court and the hoop, rather than by practicing their shooting technique. This limitation highlights the potential influence of methodological factors on study outcomes and the importance of carefully considering these factors when interpreting results.</li><li><strong>Underpowered Study:</strong> The study&#x27;s power analysis indicated it was underpowered for the primary outcome, which makes it difficult to detect statistically significant interactions and draw definitive conclusions. It&#x27;s like using a weak telescope to observe distant stars - you might not be able to see faint objects or subtle details. This limitation highlights the importance of adequately powering studies to ensure reliable and meaningful results.</li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear acknowledgment of study limitations</strong>
        <p>The limitations section transparently acknowledges the specific constraints of the study, such as the focus on lower-body training in young, resistance-trained males, and the short-term nature of the intervention. This strengthens the study by providing context for interpreting the results and acknowledging the boundaries of generalizability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Certainly, our study has limitations that must be addressed." (Page 24)</div>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Analyze impact of high dropout rate</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the discussion of limitations by providing a more thorough analysis of the potential impact of the high dropout rate. While the section mentions the dropout rate, it does not fully explore how this attrition might have affected the study&#x27;s findings and conclusions.  The Limitations section needs a more in-depth discussion of the dropout rate to address potential concerns about selection bias and reduced statistical power.  Expanding on this analysis would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a critical evaluation of the study&#x27;s limitations and their potential influence on the results.  This would enhance the study&#x27;s scientific rigor and provide valuable insights for future research.  Ultimately, a more thorough analysis of the dropout rate&#x27;s impact would significantly improve the limitations section by fostering a deeper understanding of the study&#x27;s constraints and their potential implications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This circumstance, combined with a very specialized population, resulted in a substantial dropout rate" (Page 25)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the potential impact of the high dropout rate on the study&#x27;s findings. Consider factors like selection bias, reduced statistical power, and the representativeness of the final sample. For example: &quot;The high dropout rate (approximately 45%) due to the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant limitation of this study.  This attrition may have introduced selection bias, as participants who dropped out may have differed systematically from those who completed the study.  The reduced sample size also likely decreased the study&#x27;s statistical power, potentially leading to Type II errors.  Furthermore, the final sample may not be fully representative of the original population, limiting the generalizability of the findings.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detail limitations of uncontrolled nutrition</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the limitations section by providing a more detailed discussion of the limitations related to the lack of nutritional control. While the section mentions this as a limitation, it doesn&#x27;t fully explore the potential implications for the study&#x27;s findings.  The Limitations section needs more detail about the potential impact of uncontrolled nutrition to ensure transparency and allow readers to fully assess the study&#x27;s limitations.  Expanding on this discussion would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a thorough understanding of the potential confounding factors and their possible influence on the results.  This would enhance the study&#x27;s scientific rigor and provide valuable insights for future research.  Ultimately, a more detailed discussion of the nutritional control limitation would significantly improve the limitations section by fostering a deeper understanding of the study&#x27;s constraints and their potential implications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we did not control or monitor nutritional intake, which may impair ROI-FFM, muscle thickness, and performance improvements." (Page 25)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion of the nutritional control limitation to include specific examples of how uncontrolled nutrition might have affected the outcome measures. For example: &quot;The lack of nutritional control is another limitation of this study.  Participants&#x27; protein and calorie intake were not monitored or controlled, which could have influenced their muscle growth and strength adaptations.  Some participants may have consumed insufficient protein or calories to support optimal muscle growth, while others may have overconsumed, potentially leading to increased fat mass.  This variability in nutritional intake could have confounded the effects of the training intervention, making it difficult to isolate the specific impact of the volume increases.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Similar Hypertrophy Across All Groups:</strong> The primary finding of this study refutes the initial hypothesis that individualizing volume increases based on previous training would lead to superior muscle hypertrophy compared to maintaining current volume.  All three groups, including the control group (CON) that maintained their training volume, experienced similar increases in both regional fat-free mass (ROI-FFM), measured by DEXA scans (like using a sophisticated scale to measure muscle mass), and muscle thickness (MT), measured by ultrasound (like using sonar to measure muscle depth).  This suggests that, for trained individuals, simply increasing training volume doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to greater muscle growth, provided a sufficient training stimulus is maintained.</li><li><strong>Control Group Demonstrated Superior Strength Gains:</strong> The study&#x27;s findings regarding maximal strength contradicted the initial hypothesis.  The CON group, which maintained their training volume, unexpectedly showed the greatest gains in 1RM back squat strength compared to the groups that increased their volume (G30 and G60).  This is like finding that a smaller, well-maintained engine can sometimes outperform a larger, less efficient one.  This suggests that for trained individuals, maintaining a moderate training volume may be more effective for maximizing strength gains than simply increasing volume.</li><li><strong>Moderate Volume Increase Enhanced Strength-Endurance:</strong> The G30 group, which increased their training volume by 30%, was the only group to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in strength-endurance, measured by repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% of 1RM.  This is like a marathon runner increasing their mileage moderately and seeing an improvement in their ability to run farther at a steady pace.  This finding suggests that a moderate increase in training volume may be beneficial for enhancing the ability to sustain muscular effort over time.</li><li><strong>Practical Implications for Training:</strong> The study concludes that for resistance-trained males, maintaining a moderate training volume (around 12 weekly sets) is sufficient for promoting muscle growth and may even be superior for maximal strength gains compared to higher volume training.  It also suggests that a moderate volume increase (30%) might be beneficial for strength-endurance.  These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing training programs for experienced lifters, emphasizing the importance of individualizing training volume based on individual needs and training goals.</li>

        <strong>Integrate study limitations into interpretation</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion to enhance the conclusion by providing a more nuanced and comprehensive interpretation of the findings in light of the study&#x27;s limitations. While the conclusion summarizes the results, it doesn&#x27;t fully integrate the limitations discussed in the preceding section. The Conclusion section needs to explicitly address the limitations to avoid overgeneralizing the findings and to provide a more balanced perspective. Integrating the limitations into the conclusion would strengthen the paper by demonstrating a critical awareness of the study&#x27;s constraints and their potential impact on the interpretation of the results. This would enhance the study&#x27;s scientific rigor and provide a more cautious and contextualized conclusion. Ultimately, acknowledging the limitations within the conclusion would significantly improve the paper by ensuring a more accurate and balanced interpretation of the findings.</p>

        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two acknowledging the limitations and their potential impact on the interpretation of the findings. For example: &quot;However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously considering the study&#x27;s limitations, such as the specific population studied, the short-term intervention period, and the lack of nutritional control.  Future research addressing these limitations is needed to confirm and generalize these findings.&quot;</p>

        <strong>Provide specific recommendations for practitioners</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion to strengthen the conclusion by providing more specific and actionable recommendations for practitioners. While the conclusion mentions practical implications, it lacks concrete guidance for coaches and athletes. The Conclusion section needs to offer more specific recommendations to bridge the gap between research and practice. Providing actionable recommendations would strengthen the paper by enhancing its practical relevance and impact. This would make the study&#x27;s findings more applicable to real-world training scenarios and provide valuable guidance for practitioners in the field. Ultimately, including specific recommendations for practitioners would significantly improve the conclusion by increasing its practical value and facilitating the translation of research into practice.</p>
        <div class="quote">"maintaining a moderate (~12 weekly sets) RT volume has no adverse effect" (Page 26)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two providing specific recommendations for practitioners. For example: &quot;Based on these findings, resistance-trained individuals seeking to maximize muscle growth and strength may benefit from maintaining a moderate training volume of approximately 12 weekly sets per muscle group, ensuring a high level of effort (0-2 RIR) in each set.  Moderate increases in volume (e.g., 30%) may be beneficial for enhancing strength-endurance.&quot;</p>
