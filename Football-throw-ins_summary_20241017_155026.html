            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This research investigates the impact of throw-ins on soccer performance, a relatively understudied set piece compared to free kicks and corners. The study analyzed over 16,000 throw-ins from the 2018-2019 English Premier League season to determine the relationship between throw-in performance (first contact success, possession retention, time in possession, and shot creation) and a team&#39;s final league position. Additionally, it examined how throw-in direction (backward, lateral, forward) and length affect these performance metrics. The study found a correlation between higher league positions and better throw-in performance, particularly for backward and lateral throw-ins, which were associated with higher first contact success, possession retention, and shot creation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for a study on the impact of throw-ins in professional soccer. It emphasizes that while other set pieces like free kicks and corners have been extensively studied, throw-ins remain largely unexamined. The introduction highlights the frequency of throw-ins in a match, suggesting their potential importance in influencing possession and match outcomes. It also points out the existing gap in research regarding the strategic use of throw-ins and how different approaches (e.g., direction, length) might affect a team&#39;s success. The study aims to address this gap by investigating the relationship between throw-in performance and overall team success, as well as the influence of throw-in direction and length on key performance indicators like first contact success, possession retention, and shot creation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Importance of Set Pieces:</strong> The introduction establishes that set pieces are crucial in soccer, contributing significantly to goals scored, and are a key focus of training. This context highlights the need to understand the role of throw-ins as a set piece.</li><li><strong>Frequency of Throw-ins:</strong> The introduction emphasizes that throw-ins occur more frequently than other set pieces, suggesting their potential impact on possession and match outcomes. This justifies the study&#39;s focus on throw-ins as a potentially influential aspect of the game.</li><li><strong>Lack of Research on Throw-ins:</strong> The introduction highlights the limited research on throw-in strategies, contrasting it with the extensive research on other set pieces. This clearly identifies the research gap the study aims to fill.</li><li><strong>Focus on Possession and Shot Creation:</strong> The introduction links throw-in strategy to the important aspects of possession retention and shot creation, suggesting that throw-ins can directly influence a team&#39;s ability to control the game and create scoring opportunities.</li><li><strong>Anecdotal vs. Empirical Evidence:</strong> The introduction contrasts anecdotal coaching practices (e.g., &quot;work the line&quot;) with the need for empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of different throw-in strategies. This sets the stage for the study&#39;s data-driven approach.</li></ul>

        <strong>Clear articulation of research aims.</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly states the study&#39;s two main aims: examining the link between throw-in performance and overall soccer performance, and investigating the effect of throw-in direction and length on key performance indicators. This provides a clear focus and direction for the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Therefore, this research aimed to firstly examine if throw-in performance is linked with soccer performance, and secondly the effect throw-in direction and length has on first contact success rate, possession retention, mean time in possession, and shot creation during the English Premier League 2018–2019 season." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details how the researchers investigated the relationship between throw-in strategies and soccer performance. They analyzed data from all 380 English Premier League matches during the 2018-2019 season, focusing on 16,154 throw-ins. The data, sourced from the StatsBomb database, included information about the throw-in location, direction, length, outcome, and subsequent possession. The researchers categorized throw-ins based on length (short, medium, long), direction (backwards, lateral, forwards), and pitch location. They then analyzed how these factors related to first contact success, possession retention, time in possession, and shot creation. To ensure data reliability, a subset of matches was independently coded and compared to the StatsBomb data, showing excellent agreement. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, correlations, and three-way ANOVAs to examine the relationships between the variables.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>

Outcome variables included first contact success, possession retention, time in possession, and shot creation.</li><li><strong>Data Reliability:</strong> The reliability of the StatsBomb data was verified by independent coding of three randomly selected matches, achieving excellent agreement (Cohen&#39;s kappa = 0.97).</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlations, and three-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine the relationships between throw-in characteristics and performance outcomes.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive data source.</strong>
        <p>Using data from all 380 EPL matches provides a large and representative sample, increasing the generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Raw coded data on throw-in phases of play was exported from each of the 380 games during the 2018/2019 English Premier League season from the Statsbomb database (https://statsbomb.com)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear variable definitions.</strong>
        <p>The study clearly defines the independent variables (length, direction, location) and dependent variables (first contact success, possession retention, etc.), ensuring clarity and reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Based on the performance indicators, three independent variables were examined, length (short, medium, long), direction (backwards, lateral, forwards) and pitch location (4 areas, see Figure 1). The effect of these independent variables was examined via four dependant variables, first contact success, possession retention success, mean time in possession, and shot creation (see Table 2 and Figure 1 for categories and definitions)." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Reliability check.</strong>
        <p>Independently coding a subset of matches and calculating Cohen&#39;s kappa demonstrates a strong commitment to data reliability and strengthens the validity of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Cohen’s kappa coefficient was calculated, based on analysis of 106 throw-ins, with a kappa value of k ¼ 0.97 representing excellent reliability.20" (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Justify the 7-second threshold for possession retention.</strong>
        <p>The rationale for using 7 seconds as the cutoff for successful possession retention is not explicitly stated. Providing a justification would strengthen the methodological rigor.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Successful: The ball is retained in possession (as defined above) for 7 seconds from the point in which the ball is thrown." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clear justification for the 7-second threshold would enhance the transparency and interpretability of the results related to possession retention.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explain why 7 seconds was chosen, perhaps referencing previous research or providing a logical explanation based on the dynamics of soccer.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the definition of &quot;shot creation&quot;.</strong>
        <p>While the method section mentions &quot;shot creation,&quot; it doesn&#39;t explicitly define what constitutes a shot. Does it include blocked shots, shots off target, or only shots on goal?</p>
        <div class="quote">"Shot Creation: A shot was recorded when a player attempted a shot at goal which resulted from the throw-in possession." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A precise definition of &quot;shot creation&quot; is crucial for accurate interpretation of the results. Different definitions can lead to different conclusions about the effectiveness of throw-in strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more specific definition of &quot;shot creation,&quot; clarifying whether it includes all shot attempts or only those meeting certain criteria (e.g., on target, resulting in a goal).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detail on the exclusion criteria.</strong>
        <p>The method section mentions excluding throw-ins from injury clearances. Providing more detail on what constitutes an &quot;injury clearance&quot; and how these were identified would improve transparency.</p>
        <div class="quote">"After excluding throws-ins from injury clearances (i.e. possession freely given back to the opposition following the ball being kicked out of play due to an injury) a total of 16,154 throw-in’s were included in the sample (see Table 1) and resulted on average of 808 throw-in’s per team (range 716–912 throw-ins)." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed explanation of the exclusion criteria would enhance the reproducibility of the study and allow readers to better understand the sample selection process.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more precise definition of &quot;injury clearance&quot; and explain how these events were identified in the data. For example, specify whether this information was directly available in the StatsBomb data or if it required additional coding or interpretation.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the results of the study, starting with descriptive statistics of the throw-ins. It then details the correlations found between a team&#39;s final league position and their throw-in performance metrics (first contact success, possession retention, time in possession, and shot creation). The results also show how throw-in direction and length influence these performance outcomes. Key findings include a positive correlation between higher league position and better throw-in performance, and the superior effectiveness of backward and lateral throw-ins compared to forward throws, especially in terms of first contact success and possession retention. The results also highlight how different throw-in strategies affect the likelihood of creating a shot at goal.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Correlation between League Position and Throw-in Performance:</strong> Teams higher in the league standings demonstrated better performance in first contact success, possession retention, time in possession, and shot creation from throw-ins.</li><li><strong>Influence of Throw-in Direction:</strong> Backward and lateral throw-ins were significantly more successful in achieving first contact and retaining possession compared to forward throws.</li><li><strong>Impact of Throw-in Length:</strong> Longer forward throws were found to be the least effective, resulting in lower first contact success and possession retention.</li><li><strong>Possession Retention and Time in Possession:</strong> Backward throws led to the longest average possession times, suggesting a strategic advantage in controlling the game.</li><li><strong>Shot Creation:</strong> Backward and lateral throw-ins were more likely to result in shots at goal compared to forward throws, highlighting their potential for creating scoring opportunities.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear presentation of descriptive statistics.</strong>
        <p>Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview of the throw-in data, including frequencies and percentages for different lengths, directions, and pitch locations. This allows readers to quickly grasp the distribution of throw-in characteristics and their associated outcomes.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Descriptive analysis is presented in Table 3." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed statistical analysis.</strong>
        <p>The use of correlations and three-way ANOVAs allows for a thorough examination of the relationships between throw-in strategies and performance outcomes. The reporting of F-statistics, p-values, and effect sizes strengthens the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The three-way repeated measure ANOVA showed an interaction for direction * length * location for first contact success F(2.623, 49.830) ¼ 20.773, p &lt; 0.001, gp2 ¼ .522." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Effective use of visuals.</strong>
        <p>Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 effectively illustrate the key findings, making the results more accessible and easier to understand. The figures complement the statistical analysis and provide a visual representation of the relationships between variables.</p>
        <div class="quote">"see Figure 2" (Page 5)</div>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more context for the correlation results.</strong>
        <p>While the correlations between league position and throw-in performance are presented, the practical significance of these correlations could be further emphasized. For example, how much of a difference in league position is associated with a certain improvement in throw-in success?</p>
        <div class="quote">"There was a relationship between league position and first contact success (rs (20) ¼ (cid:2).868, p &lt; 0.001), possession retention success (rs (20) ¼ (cid:2).768, p &lt; 0.001), mean time in possession after the throw-in (rs (20) ¼ (cid:2).738, p &lt; 0.001) and throw-ins resulting in a shot from the possession achieved after a successful first contact (rs (20) ¼ (cid:2).710, p &lt; 0.05)" (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Adding context to the correlation results would make the findings more meaningful and relevant for coaches and practitioners.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide examples of how differences in throw-in performance translate to differences in league standing or other relevant outcomes.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the interpretation of the interaction effects.</strong>
        <p>The results section mentions several interaction effects, but their interpretation could be clearer. What do these interactions mean in terms of how throw-in strategies differ across pitch locations and lengths?</p>
        <div class="quote">"The three-way repeated measure ANOVA showed an interaction for direction * length * location for first contact success F(2.623, 49.830) ¼ 20.773, p &lt; 0.001, gp2 ¼ .522." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clearer explanation of the interaction effects would enhance the understanding of how different throw-in strategies interact with each other and with pitch location.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed interpretation of the interaction effects, explaining how the relationship between throw-in direction and performance outcomes changes depending on the length and location of the throw-in.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the limitations of the statistical analysis.</strong>
        <p>The results section could benefit from a brief discussion of the limitations of the statistical analysis. For example, are there any potential confounding variables that were not accounted for?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging the limitations of the analysis would strengthen the research by demonstrating awareness of potential biases or limitations in the interpretation of the results.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief paragraph discussing any potential limitations of the statistical analysis, such as the possibility of confounding variables or the assumptions of the statistical tests.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section interprets the study&#39;s findings on how throw-in strategies relate to soccer performance in the 2018-2019 English Premier League. The study found that higher-ranked teams had better throw-in performance (first contact success, possession retention, and shot creation). Backward and lateral throw-ins proved more effective than forward throws, challenging traditional coaching practices. The discussion explores why backward and lateral throw-ins might be advantageous, suggesting they allow more time and space for building attacks, while forward throws often lead to contested situations and turnovers. The findings highlight the importance of strategic throw-ins for gaining and maintaining possession, creating scoring opportunities, and potentially influencing match outcomes. The discussion also acknowledges the need for further research to confirm these findings and explore the tactical implications in more detail.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Correlation between Throw-in Performance and League Position:</strong> Higher-ranked teams exhibited better throw-in performance, suggesting a link between throw-in strategy and overall success. This raises the question of whether better throw-in execution leads to higher league positions or vice-versa.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness of Backward and Lateral Throw-ins:</strong> Backward and lateral throw-ins were more successful in terms of first contact success, possession retention, and shot creation, challenging the common practice of throwing forward. This suggests a potential tactical advantage in using these less conventional directions.</li><li><strong>Ineffectiveness of Forward Throw-ins:</strong> Forward throws, especially long ones, were found to be less effective, likely due to increased competition from opposing players. This challenges traditional coaching wisdom and suggests a need for re-evaluating common throw-in strategies.</li><li><strong>Impact of Throw-in Strategy on Possession and Shot Creation:</strong> The study highlights how different throw-in directions affect possession time and the likelihood of creating scoring opportunities. Backward throws, in particular, were associated with longer possession times, potentially allowing for more controlled build-up play.</li><li><strong>Need for Further Research:</strong> The discussion acknowledges the limitations of the study, such as using data from a single season, and emphasizes the need for further research to validate the findings and explore tactical implications in more detail. This encourages future studies to investigate the observed patterns across different leagues and contexts.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear summary of key findings.</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings of the study, highlighting the relationship between throw-in performance and league position, as well as the effectiveness of different throw-in directions. This provides a concise overview of the key takeaways.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This research firstly examined if throw-in performance was correlated to final league position, and then how throw-in direction and length affected first contact success rate, possession retention, and shot creation during the English Premier league 2018-2019 season." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Logical explanation of observed patterns.</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides plausible explanations for why backward and lateral throw-ins might be more effective than forward throws. The reasoning about reduced pressure and increased time and space for building attacks is consistent with the findings and adds depth to the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It’s suggested when throwing backwards or laterally, compared to throwing forwards, teams may not apply pressure high up the pitch allowing the receiver to secure possession with time and space to build an effective attack." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Practical implications for coaching practices.</strong>
        <p>The discussion highlights the practical implications of the findings for coaches, suggesting that they should reconsider traditional throw-in strategies and explore the potential benefits of backward and lateral throws. This makes the research relevant for practitioners and encourages the adoption of evidence-based coaching methods.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The findings here provide a starting point to support the importance of coaches focusing on the use of throw-in strategy to increase possession and chance creations within professional soccer." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Further explore the tactical implications of the findings.</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions the tactical implications, it could delve deeper into how specific team formations or playing styles might interact with different throw-in strategies. For example, how might a high-pressing team utilize backward throws differently compared to a team that plays a more defensive style?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed exploration of tactical implications would enhance the practical value of the research and provide more specific guidance for coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide examples of how different teams could integrate the findings into their tactical approaches, considering various playing styles and game situations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the potential limitations of using a single league&#39;s data.</strong>
        <p>The discussion acknowledges the limitation of using data from a single season, but it could also address the potential limitations of focusing on a single league (the EPL). Do the findings generalize to other leagues with different playing styles or levels of competition?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing the potential limitations of using EPL data would strengthen the research by acknowledging the context-specific nature of the findings and encouraging further research in other leagues.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two discussing the potential limitations of using EPL data and the need for research in other leagues to assess the generalizability of the findings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify the impact of different throw-in strategies on match outcomes.</strong>
        <p>While the discussion links throw-in performance to league position, it could further quantify the impact of different throw-in strategies on match outcomes (e.g., wins, losses, draws). For example, how much does a team&#39;s likelihood of winning increase if they effectively utilize backward throws?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying the impact on match outcomes would strengthen the argument for the importance of throw-in strategy and provide a more direct measure of its influence on team success.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct further analysis to determine the relationship between throw-in strategies and match outcomes, and report these findings in the discussion.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This conclusion summarizes the study&#39;s findings on the relationship between throw-in success and soccer team performance. The research suggests a link between how teams perform on throw-ins and their final league standing. Specifically, throwing the ball laterally or backward, rather than forward, is associated with greater success in various aspects of throw-in plays, such as first contact success, possession retention, and shot creation. Higher-ranked teams tend to utilize this backward/lateral strategy more often. The authors suggest that coaches should re-evaluate their throw-in strategies to potentially improve team performance.</p>
