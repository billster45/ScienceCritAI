            <h3>Watermarking with SynthID-Text</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the technical workings of SynthID-Text, a generative watermarking scheme for LLMs. It explains how SynthID-Text modifies the token sampling process during text generation to embed a watermark without significantly impacting text quality. The section describes the three core components: a random seed generator, a sampling algorithm (Tournament Sampling), and a scoring function. It also mentions the integration of SynthID-Text with speculative sampling for enhanced generation speed.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Generative Watermarking Process:</strong> SynthID-Text alters the standard LLM text generation process by subtly modifying the next-token sampling procedure. This introduces a statistical signature that can be later detected to verify the text&#39;s origin.</li><li><strong>Components of SynthID-Text:</strong> The watermarking scheme consists of three main parts: a random seed generator (e.g., sliding-window method), a sampling algorithm (Tournament Sampling), and a scoring function. These work together to embed and detect the watermark.</li><li><strong>Tournament Sampling:</strong> This novel sampling algorithm is central to SynthID-Text. It uses a tournament-like process to select output tokens that align with both the LLM&#39;s probability distribution and the watermarking requirements.</li><li><strong>Scoring Function:</strong> The scoring function measures the correlation between the generated text and the watermarking key, providing a score that indicates the likelihood of the text being watermarked.</li><li><strong>Integration with Speculative Sampling:</strong> SynthID-Text can be combined with speculative sampling, a technique used to speed up LLM text generation, demonstrating its practical applicability in performance-sensitive environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of the Watermarking Process</strong>
        <p>The section provides a step-by-step explanation of how SynthID-Text embeds watermarks during text generation, making the complex process understandable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Generative watermarking (Fig. 1, bottom) works by carefully modifying the next-token sampling procedure to inject subtle, context-specific modifications into the generated text distribution." (Page 2)</div>

        <strong>Detailed Description of Components</strong>
        <p>The section clearly describes the three core components of SynthID-Text and how they interact, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system&#39;s architecture.</p>
        <div class="quote">"A generative watermarking scheme typically comprises three components: a random seed generator, a sampling algorithm and a scoring function21." (Page 2)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Tournament Sampling</strong>
        <p>While the section introduces Tournament Sampling, it lacks a detailed explanation of its algorithm. Providing more details would enhance the technical understanding of this crucial component.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this work, we present the sampling algorithm Tournament sampling, which is described in the following section." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A deeper understanding of Tournament Sampling would allow readers to grasp the core innovation of SynthID-Text.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a more detailed explanation of the Tournament Sampling algorithm, including its steps, parameters, and how it balances watermarking with text quality.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Examples of Scoring Functions</strong>
        <p>The section mentions several scoring functions but doesn&#39;t provide specific examples. Including examples would clarify how the watermark is detected in practice.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We experiment with several scoring functions, some of which are from existing work and others are from this work; we discuss them in the following sections." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would make the concept of scoring functions more tangible and easier to understand.</p>

            <h3>Preserving the quality of generative text</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section focuses on how SynthID-Text preserves the quality of generated text while still effectively embedding watermarks. It introduces the concept of &quot;non-distortion&quot; and defines its varying levels, from single-token to multi-sequence. The section explains how Tournament Sampling, when configured correctly, can achieve these levels of non-distortion, impacting the trade-off between text quality, diversity, detectability, and computational complexity.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Distortion in Watermarking:</strong> This section defines non-distortion as a measure of how much the watermarking process alters the original LLM&#39;s text distribution. Different levels of non-distortion are introduced, ranging from single-token to entire sequences of text.</li><li><strong>Levels of Non-Distortion:</strong> The section outlines different levels of non-distortion: single-token (average distribution of individual tokens remains unchanged), single-sequence (probability of generating a specific sequence is unchanged), and multi-sequence (probability of generating multiple sequences is unchanged).</li><li><strong>Tournament Sampling and Non-Distortion:</strong> It&#39;s explained that Tournament Sampling with two competitors per match achieves single-token non-distortion. Repeated context masking can further enhance this to single or multi-sequence non-distortion.</li><li><strong>Trade-offs in Non-Distortion:</strong> The section discusses the trade-offs involved in choosing the level of non-distortion. Weaker non-distortion can impact text quality and diversity, while stronger levels can reduce detectability and increase computational cost.</li><li><strong>SynthID-Text Configuration:</strong> The section specifies that SynthID-Text is configured for single-sequence non-distortion in the experiments, balancing the trade-offs between quality preservation and detectability.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Definitions of Non-Distortion</strong>
        <p>The section provides clear definitions for different levels of non-distortion, resolving potential ambiguity in the literature.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this work, we resolve the confusion by providing clear definitions of non-distortion, from weakest to strongest." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Illustrative Examples of Non-Distortion Impact</strong>
        <p>While the section explains the trade-offs theoretically, it lacks concrete examples. Illustrative examples would make the impact of different non-distortion levels more tangible.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Choosing the level of non-distortion involves a trade-off; weaker levels of non-distortion can reduce text quality and diversity, whereas stronger levels of non-distortion can reduce detectability and increase computational complexity" (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand the practical implications of choosing different non-distortion levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide examples of how text quality, diversity, and detectability are affected by different non-distortion levels. For instance, show examples of generated text with varying levels of non-distortion and their corresponding detectability scores.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Justification for Single-Sequence Non-Distortion</strong>
        <p>The section states that SynthID-Text is configured for single-sequence non-distortion but doesn&#39;t fully justify this choice. Providing a more detailed rationale would strengthen the argument.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For our experiments, we configure SynthID-Text to be single-sequence non-distortionary; this" (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would clarify why single-sequence non-distortion is the preferred configuration for the experiments.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explain the specific reasons for choosing single-sequence non-distortion, considering the trade-offs discussed and the specific goals of the experiments.</p>

            <h3>Ensuring computational scalability</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the watermark detection process in SynthID-Text and discusses factors influencing its performance, such as text length and LLM distribution entropy. It also explains how the number of tournament layers (m) affects detectability and the rationale behind choosing m=30. Finally, it introduces the concept of non-distortion and its various levels, highlighting the trade-offs involved in selecting the appropriate level and justifying the choice of single-sequence non-distortion for the experiments.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Watermark Detection:</strong> Describes how the presence of a watermark is detected in a text by calculating the mean g-values, which are expected to be higher in watermarked text.</li><li><strong>Factors Affecting Detection:</strong> Explains how text length and the entropy of the LLM distribution influence the effectiveness of watermark detection. Higher entropy generally leads to better watermarking performance.</li><li><strong>Impact of Tournament Layers:</strong> Discusses how increasing the number of tournament layers (m) improves detectability up to a certain point, with diminishing returns for higher values of m. The choice of m=30 is justified based on experimental findings.</li><li><strong>Non-Distortion and its Levels:</strong> Defines non-distortion and its levels (single-token, single-sequence, multi-sequence), explaining how they relate to preserving the original LLM text distribution.</li><li><strong>Trade-offs and Configuration:</strong> Explains the trade-offs involved in choosing the level of non-distortion, balancing text quality, detectability, and computational cost. Justifies the use of single-sequence non-distortion in the experiments.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of Detection Process</strong>
        <p>The section clearly explains how watermark detection works using the scoring function and the rationale behind it.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To detect whether a piece of text x=x1,…,xT is watermarked, we measure how highly x scores with respect to these functions." (Page 3)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Details on Entropy&#39;s Impact</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions entropy&#39;s influence, it would benefit from more specific examples of how different entropy levels affect detection performance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The second is the amount of entropy in the LLM distribution when it generates the watermarked text x." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more concrete understanding of the relationship between entropy and detectability.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include examples showing how detection accuracy varies with different levels of LLM entropy, perhaps using different LLM models or decoding settings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Diminishing Returns of Tournament Layers</strong>
        <p>The section mentions diminishing returns with increasing m but doesn&#39;t elaborate. Visualizations or quantitative data could clarify this.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, detectability does not increase indefinitely with the number of layers." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand the optimal number of layers and the trade-offs involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a graph showing the relationship between the number of layers (m) and detectability, or provide specific data points illustrating the diminishing returns.</p>

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section evaluates SynthID-Text, comparing its performance to existing watermarking methods. It focuses on demonstrating that SynthID-Text offers superior detectability while preserving text quality, diversity, and computational scalability, even in a large-scale production environment like Gemini. The evaluation includes a live experiment with Gemini, human evaluations, and comparisons to Gumbel and Soft Red List sampling algorithms.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison with Existing Methods:</strong> SynthID-Text is compared against Gumbel sampling (non-distortionary) and Soft Red List sampling (distortionary) to demonstrate its superior detectability in both categories.</li><li><strong>Quality Preservation:</strong> Evaluation demonstrates that non-distortionary SynthID-Text maintains text quality comparable to unwatermarked text, evidenced by a live experiment with Gemini and a controlled human preference test.</li><li><strong>Detectability:</strong> SynthID-Text shows improved detection performance compared to baselines while preserving more of the underlying diversity in LLM responses.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The evaluation confirms that SynthID-Text has a negligible computational impact, similar to other generative watermarking schemes, making it suitable for large-scale production LLMs.</li><li><strong>Live Experiment in Gemini:</strong> A live experiment with Gemini, involving around 20 million responses, showed statistically insignificant differences in user feedback (thumbs-up/thumbs-down) between watermarked and unwatermarked models, confirming quality preservation in a real-world setting.</li><li><strong>Human Evaluation:</strong> A controlled human preference test found no significant difference in rater preference for watermarked vs. unwatermarked responses across various quality aspects (grammaticality, relevance, correctness, helpfulness, overall quality).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Strong Empirical Evidence</strong>
        <p>The evaluation includes both a large-scale live experiment and a controlled human study, providing robust evidence for SynthID-Text&#39;s effectiveness and quality preservation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We analysed approximately 20 million watermarked and unwatermarked responses and computed the thumbs-up and thumbs-down rates" (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Real-world Applicability</strong>
        <p>The live experiment with Gemini demonstrates the practical applicability and scalability of SynthID-Text in a large-scale production environment.</p>
        <div class="quote">"From this experiment, we conclude that over a wide variety of real chatbot interactions, the difference in response quality and utility, as judged by humans, is negligible." (Page 4)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Comparison Metrics</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions superior detectability, it lacks specific metrics. Including precision, recall, and F1-scores would strengthen the comparison.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we compare against Gumbel sampling22,24, and in the distortionary category, we compare against the Soft Red List sampling algorithm23" (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more quantitative and nuanced understanding of SynthID-Text&#39;s performance compared to the baselines.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a table or figure presenting precision, recall, and F1-scores for SynthID-Text and the baseline methods across different evaluation settings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Diversity Preservation</strong>
        <p>The section mentions preserving diversity but doesn&#39;t quantify it. Including metrics or examples would clarify this aspect.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we show that SynthID-Text provides improved detection performance while also preserving a greater amount of the underlying diversity within the LLM responses." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide concrete evidence of SynthID-Text&#39;s ability to maintain diversity in generated text.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include diversity metrics (e.g., distinct n-grams, self-BLEU) or provide examples of diverse outputs generated with and without watermarking.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section provides a detailed explanation of the SynthID-Text method, including its core components: the random seed generator, the Tournament sampling algorithm, and scoring functions. It also addresses the issue of repeated context masking to maintain text quality. The section delves into the technical specifications of each component, defining key terms and algorithms involved in watermark embedding and detection.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>LLM Distribution and Decoding:</strong> SynthID-Text is compatible with various autoregressive decoding methods like top-k, top-p sampling, and temperature adjustments, as long as they maintain non-zero entropy. The LLM distribution is defined as the probability distribution after any decoding modifications.</li><li><strong>Random Seed Generator:</strong> This component generates random seeds to bias the sampling process. A deterministic function, often based on a sliding window hash of recent tokens and a watermarking key, is used to produce these seeds.</li><li><strong>G-Values and Tournament Sampling:</strong> Tournament sampling, the core sampling algorithm, uses g-values to select tokens. G-values are pseudorandom samples from a distribution (e.g., Bernoulli or Uniform) determined by a hash function of the token, layer number, and random seed. The algorithm simulates a tournament where tokens with higher g-values are more likely to be selected.</li><li><strong>Repeated Context Masking:</strong> This technique prevents the same context window and random seed from being used repeatedly, avoiding potential quality issues like repeating loops. It maintains a history of used contexts to ensure unique seeds are used.</li><li><strong>Scoring Functions:</strong> Scoring functions evaluate the likelihood of a text being watermarked by analyzing its g-values. Several scoring functions are proposed, including mean score, weighted mean score, frequentist scores (P-values), and a Bayesian scoring function.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
            <li>The figure demonstrates how Tournament Sampling combines probabilistic sampling with deterministic selection based on g-values. This process aims to embed a watermark while still respecting the underlying LLM distribution.</li><li>This method has implications for the detectability and robustness of the watermark, which are key considerations for practical applications.</li><li>The figure directly contributes to the research objective of explaining the core mechanism of SynthID-Text.</li><li>A potential improvement would be to add a legend explaining the meaning of the colors and arrows in the bottom panel. More explicit labeling of the steps in the tournament process would also enhance clarity. Additionally, showing how the random seed and context influence the g-values in the top panel could be helpful. Finally, explicitly stating that the figure is illustrating a specific example (m=3, 8 samples) and that other configurations are possible would prevent potential misunderstandings.</li></ul></div>

            <div class="critique-title">Key Values</div>
            <ul>
            <li>m = 3 (number of watermarking functions/tournament layers)</li><li>2m = 8 (number of candidate tokens sampled)</li><li>0.50, 0.30, 0.15, 0.05 (LLM probabilities for example tokens)</li><li>0/1 (g-values assigned by watermarking functions)</li><li>The values m=3 and 2m=8 are important because they define the specific instance of the tournament algorithm being illustrated. The LLM probabilities demonstrate how the initial candidates are sampled. The binary g-values (0 or 1) simplify the comparison process within the tournament. The figure caption notes that other values of m and numbers of samples are possible.</li><li>These specific values are chosen for illustrative purposes. The paper later explores different configurations and their impact on performance.</li></ul></div>

                <div class="critique-title">Summary</div>
                <p>This figure illustrates the Tournament Sampling algorithm, the core of SynthID-Text. The top panel shows how watermarking functions use a random seed and recent context to assign scores to vocabulary tokens. The bottom panel visualizes the tournament process itself, where candidate tokens are sampled from the LLM distribution and then compete based on their g-values, progressing through multiple layers until a final winner is selected as the output token.</p>

            <div class="critique-title">Methodological Critique</div>
            <ul>
            <li>Visualizing the tournament process as a bracket clarifies how tokens are compared and selected at each layer. The top panel provides necessary context by showing how the g-values are generated.</li><li>The figure uses a specific example (m=3, 2m=8 samples) to make the process concrete. However, it doesn&#39;t explicitly state that this is an example and that the number of layers and samples can vary. This could be a source of confusion.</li><li>The figure supports the claims about the tournament sampling process by visually depicting the steps involved. However, it doesn&#39;t provide evidence for the effectiveness of this method, which is addressed later in the paper.</li><li>The figure generally aligns with scientific visualization standards. However, the connection between the top and bottom panels could be made clearer. It&#39;s not immediately obvious how the g-values from the top panel are used in the tournament.</li></ul></div>

            <div class="critique-title">Presentation Critique</div>
            <ul>
            <li>The figure is relatively clear, but the explanation of the process could be improved. Terms like &quot;random watermarking functions&quot; and &quot;g-values&quot; are used without sufficient context within the figure itself.</li><li>The visual organization is generally effective, but the connection between the two panels could be strengthened. The use of color in the bottom panel helps to track the progression of the tournament.</li><li>The figure is appropriate for a technical audience familiar with LLMs and sampling algorithms. However, readers unfamiliar with these concepts may find it challenging to follow.</li><li>The figure adheres to some conventions for algorithm visualization, but it could benefit from more explicit labeling and explanations within the figure itself.</li></ul></div>
