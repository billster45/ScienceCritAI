        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research explores the potential of AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), an AI system, to address the global shortage of subspecialist medical expertise, particularly in complex cardiology cases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Using a real-world dataset of 204 complex cases from a subspecialist cardiology practice at Stanford, the study compares AMIE&#39;s performance to that of three general cardiologists in diagnosing and managing rare cardiac diseases. The study employs a blinded, counterbalanced reader study design, where both AMIE and cardiologists independently assess cases, followed by cardiologists revising their assessments after reviewing AMIE&#39;s output. Four subspecialist cardiologists then evaluate all responses using a ten-domain rubric, comparing AMIE&#39;s performance with general cardiologists and assessing the impact of AMIE assistance on cardiologist responses. The study aims to evaluate AMIE&#39;s diagnostic capabilities, its potential as an assistive tool, and its implications for democratizing access to specialized medical knowledge.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>AMIE demonstrated superior performance to general cardiologists in five out of ten domains:</strong> explaining the rationale for suspecting a genetic heart condition, providing additional patient information, providing additional test information, suggesting management plans, and explaining genetic test results. This suggests AMIE&#39;s ability to provide comprehensive explanations and integrate genetic information effectively. This finding implies that AI systems can excel in specific areas of complex medical reasoning, potentially augmenting human expertise in those areas.</li><li>Access to AMIE&#39;s responses significantly improved general cardiologists&#39; overall response quality in 63.7% of cases and across all individual assessment domains. Cardiologists were more likely to revise their initial assessments after reviewing AMIE&#39;s responses, adopting the AI&#39;s suggestions for diagnosis and management, which further supports AMIE&#39;s potential as an effective assistive tool. This improvement in cardiologist performance suggests that AI can assist general practitioners in handling complex cases, potentially bridging the expertise gap and improving patient care.</li><li>AMIE exhibited a higher rate of clinically significant errors (21.6%) compared to general cardiologists (10.8%), primarily related to suggesting unnecessary further investigations (over-testing) and premature treatment. These errors highlight the risk of over-reliance on AI and emphasize the need for human oversight in clinical decision-making. This high error rate is a critical consideration for the implementation of AI in healthcare and necessitates further development to reduce unnecessary interventions and improve diagnostic accuracy.</li><li>General cardiologists were more concise in their responses but tended to omit crucial information or exhibit biases related to demographic factors more often than AMIE. This omission of information highlights the value of AMIE&#39;s thoroughness in considering a broader range of possibilities and suggests a complementary approach where AI assists in ensuring comprehensive assessment. The observation that general cardiologists made more errors of omission indicates that they may benefit from an assistive tool like AMIE to provide more comprehensive care, especially in rare and complex cases.</li><li>AMIE proved to be data-efficient, requiring clinical data from only nine patients for adaptation to the subspecialist domain of inherited cardiomyopathies. This data efficiency highlights the potential of AI to rapidly acquire specialized knowledge and suggests its applicability in resource-limited settings. This efficiency implies that AI can be trained effectively with relatively small datasets, making it a promising solution for specialized medical domains where data acquisition is challenging.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study used a real-world dataset of complex cardiology cases, increasing the relevance and applicability of the findings to clinical practice. The rigorous evaluation process, involving blinded assessments by both general and subspecialist cardiologists, and a detailed ten-domain rubric, ensures the objectivity and validity of the results.</li><li>The study design, incorporating a blinded, counterbalanced approach and a two-month washout period for cardiologists before revising their assessments, minimizes bias and strengthens the methodological rigor. The inclusion of both direct comparison and individual assessments provides a comprehensive evaluation of AMIE&#39;s performance.</li><li>The study clearly explains the development and adaptation of AMIE to the subspecialist domain, using a few-shot learning approach with self-critique and search retrieval augmentation. This detailed description enhances the reproducibility of the study and allows for a better understanding of AMIE&#39;s capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study relies solely on text-based reports, excluding patient history, physical examination data, and image data. Future research should incorporate multimodal data, including images and patient-reported outcomes, to provide a more holistic assessment and better reflect real-world clinical practice. This inclusion of multimodal data would improve the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings.</li><li>The study focuses on a single center and uses only English text, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Future research should include data from diverse populations and languages to assess AMIE&#39;s performance across different healthcare settings and patient demographics. This would address potential biases related to language and healthcare access and improve the generalizability of the AI system.</li><li>The study lacks a discussion of the ethical implications of using AI in clinical decision-making, particularly regarding patient autonomy, informed consent, and data privacy. Future research should address these ethical considerations to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of AI in healthcare. This would promote trust and address potential concerns about the use of AI in sensitive medical contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table provides crucial quantitative evidence supporting AMIE&#39;s effectiveness as an assistive tool, demonstrating its potential to improve the quality of care provided by general cardiologists.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study demonstrates the potential of AMIE, an LLM-based AI system, to assist general cardiologists in diagnosing and managing complex inherited cardiovascular diseases. AMIE performed comparably to general cardiologists in overall assessments and even outperformed them in certain domains, particularly those involving genetic information. Importantly, access to AMIE&#39;s responses significantly improved cardiologist performance across all evaluated areas, by 60.3% for the overall response and by varying degrees for other domains. However, AMIE also exhibited a higher rate of clinically significant errors, primarily related to over-testing, which necessitates careful consideration and further refinement before clinical implementation. Future research should focus on incorporating multimodal data, including images and patient-reported outcomes, expanding the dataset to diverse populations and languages, addressing ethical implications, and developing strategies to mitigate AMIE&#39;s tendency toward over-testing while preserving its strengths in comprehensive assessment and genetic information integration. These advancements could pave the way for democratizing access to subspecialist expertise, improving the quality of care for patients with rare and complex cardiac conditions, especially in underserved areas with limited access to specialists.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the study&#39;s methodology, which involved a blinded, counterbalanced reader study to evaluate AMIE&#39;s ability to diagnose, triage, and manage patients with suspected inherited cardiovascular disease. The study used data from 204 real-world patients at the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease (SCICD), including various cardiac test results and genetic information. Three general cardiologists and AMIE independently assessed the cases, with the cardiologists later revising their assessments after reviewing AMIE&#39;s output. Subspecialist cardiologists then evaluated all responses using a rubric.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Clinical Data Acquisition:</strong> Data from 204 real-world patients at SCICD, including ECGs, TTEs, genetic testing, CMRs, Holter monitors, and CPX tests, were used. This data was made publicly available.</li><li><strong>AMIE Development and Adaptation:</strong> AMIE, an LLM-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue, was used. It was adapted to the subspecialist domain using 9 patient cases and a few-shot learning approach with self-critique and search retrieval augmentation.</li><li><strong>Study Design:</strong> The study involved a blinded, counterbalanced design where general cardiologists and AMIE independently assessed the cases. Cardiologists then revised their assessments after reviewing AMIE&#39;s responses.</li><li><strong>Subspecialist Evaluation:</strong> Four subspecialist cardiologists, blinded to the source of the responses, evaluated the assessments of both AMIE and the general cardiologists, as well as the cardiologists&#39; revised assessments.</li><li><strong>Evaluation Rubric:</strong> A ten-domain rubric was developed for subspecialists to evaluate the responses, including direct A/B preference comparisons and individual assessments of specific response qualities.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Description of Data Acquisition</strong>
        <p>The section clearly explains the source and types of clinical data used, including the specific tests and the number of patients, which enhances the study&#39;s reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This data was obtained from patients referred to the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, encompassing patients with both suspected and confirmed inherited cardiovascular diseases, and general cardiology patients." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of AMIE&#39;s Adaptation</strong>
        <p>The section provides a concise yet informative description of how AMIE was adapted to the subspecialist domain, including the prompting strategy and the use of few-shot learning.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Adaptation of AMIE to this subspecialist domain required clinical data from just nine patients. Five cases, chosen at random, were used to design an optimal approach to model prompting through iterative review and expert feedback." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-Defined Study Design</strong>
        <p>The section clearly outlines the study design, including the blinding process, the use of a counterbalanced approach, and the different stages of assessment and evaluation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The study comprised four main phases: 1. Acquisition of clinical data: Recruitment and de-identification of clinical data from a subspecialized inherited cardiovascular center, 2. Domain Adaptation of AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), 3. General cardiologist and AMIE assessment of each case, followed by revised assessment of the cases by general cardiologists when given access to the AMIE assessment outputs, and 4. Subspecialist evaluation and analysis." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Washout Period Rationale</strong>
        <p>The section mentions a 2-month washout period for cardiologists before revising their assessments, but doesn&#39;t explain its purpose. Clarifying this would strengthen the methodological rigor.</p>
        <div class="quote">"After AMIE and the general cardiologists completed their assessments individually, the cardiologists underwent a washout period of 2 months." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Explaining the rationale for the washout period, such as minimizing recall bias, would improve the transparency and validity of the study design.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief explanation for the washout period, such as &#39;to minimize recall bias&#39;.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Detail on the Assessment Form</strong>
        <p>While Figure 3 is referenced, the section could briefly describe the specific questions or tasks included in the assessment form to provide a better understanding of the evaluation process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Both AMIE and general cardiologists completed the same standardized assessment form shown in Figure 3." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would give readers a clearer picture of what was being assessed and how the responses were evaluated.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a concise summary of the key sections and questions in the assessment form, such as &#39;The assessment form included questions on overall impression, consult question, triage assessment, diagnosis, management, and the impact of genetic test results.&#39;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain the Choice of General Cardiologists</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the recruitment of general cardiologists but doesn&#39;t explain the criteria for their selection or their level of experience. Providing more detail would strengthen the study&#39;s validity.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We recruited three board-certified general cardiologists not affiliated with Stanford, who have not had dedicated training in cardiovascular genetics and had not cared for any of the studied patients." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand the generalizability of the findings and the potential impact of AMIE on different levels of expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief description of the selection criteria for the general cardiologists, such as their years of experience or their specific areas of practice.</p>

Part (a) shows how AMIE was initially trained using a simulated environment where it learned through conversations between simulated patients and doctors. Think of it like a student doctor practicing with actors playing patients. This training helps AMIE learn how to ask questions, understand symptoms, and make diagnoses. Part (b) shows how AMIE was then tested using real patient data. Out of 213 cases, 9 were used to figure out the best way to give information to AMIE and get answers from it. The remaining cases were used to compare AMIE&#39;s performance to that of human cardiologists. The cardiologists first diagnosed the cases on their own, then they got to see AMIE&#39;s diagnoses and could change their own answers if they wanted. Finally, specialist cardiologists compared the diagnoses from AMIE and the human cardiologists.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of the study comparing the performance of AMIE, an AI system, with general cardiologists in assessing patients with suspected inherited cardiovascular disease. AMIE was found to be superior to general cardiologists in five out of ten domains, including explaining the rationale for suspecting a genetic heart condition, providing additional patient and test information, suggesting management plans, and explaining genetic test results. When cardiologists had access to AMIE&#39;s responses, they significantly improved their assessments in almost all cases. While AMIE was more thorough and sensitive, it also had a higher rate of clinically significant errors, often related to suggesting unnecessary tests. General cardiologists, on the other hand, were more concise but sometimes missed crucial information.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>AMIE&#39;s Superiority in Specific Domains:</strong> AMIE outperformed general cardiologists in five domains, demonstrating its strength in providing comprehensive explanations and management suggestions, especially regarding genetic information.</li><li><strong>Improved Cardiologist Performance with AMIE Assistance:</strong> Access to AMIE&#39;s responses significantly enhanced the quality of cardiologists&#39; assessments, suggesting AMIE&#39;s potential as a valuable assistive tool.</li><li><strong>AMIE&#39;s Thoroughness and Sensitivity:</strong> AMIE&#39;s responses were generally more thorough and considered a broader range of possibilities, leading to more comprehensive evaluations.</li><li><strong>Higher Error Rate for AMIE:</strong> Despite its strengths, AMIE exhibited a higher rate of clinically significant errors, often related to over-testing or suggesting unnecessary interventions.</li><li><strong>Complementary Strengths of AMIE and Cardiologists:</strong> AMIE&#39;s thoroughness and sensitivity complemented the conciseness and specificity of general cardiologists, suggesting a potential synergistic approach to patient care.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of Results</strong>
        <p>The section presents the results in a clear and organized manner, using figures and tables to effectively communicate the key findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For the 204 patients, across the 10 evaluation domain considered, AMIE was rated superior to general cardiologists across five domains while being equivalent for the remaining domains (Figure 6a and Table A.1)." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Analysis of Preferences</strong>
        <p>The section provides a detailed analysis of the subspecialist preferences, including both direct comparisons and individual assessments, which allows for a nuanced understanding of AMIE&#39;s performance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The subspecialist evaluators first directly compared AMIE’s assessment to the general cardiologists’ assessments using the evaluation form in Figure 4." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Clinical Significance</strong>
        <p>The section highlights the clinical significance of the findings, such as the types of errors made by AMIE and cardiologists, which is crucial for understanding the real-world implications of the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"While AMIE provided more thorough assessments and exhibited fewer content omissions or biases, its increased comprehensiveness did come at the expense of a modest increase in clinically-significant errors." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Context for Table 1</strong>
        <p>Table 1 lists the availability of clinical data but lacks context regarding its relevance to the results. Explaining how this data influenced the assessments would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"204 consecutive patients were assessed by both general cardiologists and AMIE. The median age of patients was 59 years (range: 18-96 years). The number and percentage of patients with available clinical text data for each test was as follows: CMR: 121 (59.3%), CPX: 115 (56.4%), resting TTE: 172 (84.3%), exercise TTE: 131 (64.2%), ECG: 188 (92.2%), ambulatory holter monitor: 151 (74.0%), and genetic testing: 147 (72.0%) (see Table 1)." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand the potential impact of data availability on the performance of both AMIE and cardiologists.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining how the availability of different types of clinical data might have influenced the assessments, or if any missing data posed challenges.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify the Impact of AMIE Assistance on Specific Domains</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions overall improvement in cardiologist responses with AMIE assistance, quantifying this impact on each of the 10 domains would provide a more granular understanding.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Across the remaining 9 specific domains, the AMIE-assisted responses were preferred for all domains when directly compared to the general cardiologists alone, though ‘Tie’ was the most common evaluation for 8 of the 10 domains (see Figure 7 and Table A.3)." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would allow for a more detailed analysis of AMIE&#39;s contribution to improving cardiologist performance in specific areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide specific percentages or statistics showing the improvement in each domain, potentially referencing Table A.3 or adding a new table with this information.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Implications of the Error Types</strong>
        <p>The section identifies the types of errors made by AMIE and cardiologists but doesn&#39;t fully discuss their implications for clinical practice. Elaborating on this would enhance the section&#39;s impact.</p>
        <div class="quote">"AMIE’s errors were generally additive, such as suggesting further investigations (i.e., such as regular monitoring with a cardiac MRI), whereas general cardiologist’s errors tended to be omission." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and risks of using AMIE in real-world settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the potential consequences of each type of error, such as the cost and burden of unnecessary tests or the potential harm of missed diagnoses. Consider framing this discussion in terms of the trade-off between thoroughness and potential over-testing.</p>

        <p>Figure 9 illustrates a hypothetical dialogue between AMIE and a general cardiologist, showcasing how AMIE could assist in real-world clinical scenarios. The figure is divided into four parts. Part (a) summarizes the clinical data from an echocardiogram and a Holter monitor for a patient suspected of having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Part (b) presents the independent assessments of the general cardiologist and AMIE based on this data. Notice how the cardiologist initially downplays the likelihood of genetic heart disease, while AMIE suggests a higher suspicion of HCM. Part (c) shows a simulated conversation where AMIE explains its reasoning to the cardiologist, highlighting key findings like left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and the possibility of asymptomatic HCM. Part (d) provides feedback from a subspecialist cardiologist, confirming AMIE&#39;s assessment and emphasizing the importance of referral to a specialized center. This figure demonstrates AMIE&#39;s potential to provide valuable insights and guide clinical decision-making, especially in cases with subtle or complex presentations.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses the study&#39;s findings on the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically AMIE, to assist generalists in assessing rare cardiac diseases. The study used a real-world dataset of patients with suspected inherited cardiomyopathies and a specialized evaluation rubric. Key findings include AMIE&#39;s comparable performance to general cardiologists in standalone assessments, its potential to significantly improve general cardiologists&#39; diagnostic and management abilities when used as an assistive tool, and the different error profiles of AMIE (over-testing) and general cardiologists (omission). The discussion also highlights the limitations of the study, such as the use of text-based reports only and the lack of patient history and physical examination data, and emphasizes the need for further prospective research before clinical implementation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>AMIE&#39;s Performance:</strong> AMIE demonstrated comparable performance to general cardiologists in assessing patients with rare cardiac conditions, showing potential as a valuable tool in subspecialty care.</li><li><strong>Assistive Capabilities:</strong> When used as an assistive tool, AMIE significantly improved general cardiologists&#39; diagnostic and management skills, enhancing the quality of care.</li><li><strong>Error Profiles:</strong> AMIE&#39;s errors tended to be additive, often suggesting unnecessary tests, while general cardiologists&#39; errors were primarily omissions, such as missing diagnoses or necessary tests.</li><li><strong>Data Efficiency and Adaptation:</strong> AMIE&#39;s adaptation to the subspecialist domain was highly data-efficient, requiring only a small number of cases for refinement.</li><li><strong>Limitations and Future Research:</strong> The study acknowledges limitations, including the use of text-based reports only and the exclusion of patient history and physical examination, emphasizing the need for further prospective research and validation.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Discussion of Findings</strong>
        <p>The section thoroughly discusses the key findings of the study, relating them to the research question and providing context for their interpretation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing LLMs, specifically AMIE, an experimental research LLM optimized for diagnostic dialogue, to assess patients with rare and life-threatening cardiac conditions." (Page 11)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of AMIE&#39;s Strengths and Weaknesses</strong>
        <p>The section clearly articulates both the advantages and limitations of AMIE, providing a balanced perspective on its potential role in clinical practice.</p>
        <div class="quote">"While AMIE provided more thorough assessments and exhibited fewer content omissions or biases, its increased comprehensiveness did come at the expense of a modest increase in clinically-significant errors." (Page 11)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Future Research Directions</strong>
        <p>The section identifies important areas for future research, such as prospective studies and the inclusion of multimodal data, which is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring the safe and effective implementation of LLMs in healthcare.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Prior to assessing safety for clinical implementation, prospective research is necessary." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the Clinical Implications of the Error Differences</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions the different error profiles of AMIE and cardiologists, it could further explore the clinical implications of these differences. For example, how might the tendency towards over-testing by AMIE impact patient care and healthcare costs?</p>
        <div class="quote">"AMIE’s errors were generally additive, such as suggesting further investigations (i.e., such as regular monitoring with a cardiac MRI), whereas general cardiologist’s errors tended to be omission." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the potential benefits and risks of using AMIE in real-world settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the potential consequences of each error type, considering factors such as patient burden, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for delayed or missed diagnoses.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Potential for Bias in the Dataset</strong>
        <p>The discussion mentions limitations related to the dataset, such as its single-center origin and the use of English text. However, it could also address the potential for bias within the dataset itself. For example, were the patients included in the study representative of the broader population of patients with suspected inherited cardiomyopathies?</p>
        <div class="quote">"Further limitations of our work include a biased sample of patients - patients were selected from one US center, using only English text." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging and discussing potential biases in the data would strengthen the study&#39;s rigor and transparency.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two discussing the potential for selection bias or other biases within the dataset and how these biases might have influenced the results.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Connection to &quot;Democratization&quot;</strong>
        <p>While the paper&#39;s title emphasizes democratization, the discussion could more explicitly connect the findings to this theme. How does AMIE&#39;s potential to assist general cardiologists contribute to making subspecialty expertise more accessible?</p>
        <div class="quote">"If further prospective research validates our findings, LLMs may have the potential to assist generalist in providing subspecialist care." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would reinforce the paper&#39;s central argument and highlight the potential societal impact of the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining how AMIE could facilitate access to specialized knowledge in underserved areas or for patients who lack access to subspecialists.</p>

        <summary>table A.4</summary>
        <p>Table A.4 outlines the prompts given to AMIE, the AI system, in three simulated dialogue scenarios. These scenarios explore different potential clinical applications of AMIE: 1) explaining test results and diagnosis to a patient, 2) assisting a general cardiologist in deciding about specialist referral, and 3) presenting a comprehensive assessment as a specialist cardiologist. Each prompt describes a patient case and specifies the information AMIE should use and the role it should play in the conversation. For example, in the first scenario, AMIE is given echocardiogram and Holter monitor results for a 63-year-old female whose brother died from sudden cardiac death and is asked to explain these results to the patient. In the second scenario, AMIE is asked to help a general cardiologist decide whether a 54-year-old male with shortness of breath and dizziness should be referred to a specialist. In the third scenario, AMIE acts as the specialist cardiologist for a 64-year-old male and presents a complete assessment based on various test results.</p>

            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "Table A.4 | Prompts for AMIE&#39;s simulated dialogue across three scenarios: (1) AMIE reaches a diagnosis and then explains it to a patient. (2) AMIE provides assistive dialogue for a general cardiologist. (3) AMIE assumes the role of the specialist cardiologist and presents an assessment."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> For the remaining three hypothetical scenarios, AMIE was given a prompt, akin to a &#39;one-line&#39; summary of a patient (Table A.4) along with clinical data for the corresponding patient and asked to produce dialogues mirroring various potential use cases for AMIE: 1. AMIE reaches a diagnosis and then explains it to a patient (Figure A.4); 2. AMIE providing assistive dialogue for a general cardiologist (Figure A.5); 3. AMIE assumes the role of the specialist cardiologist and presents an assessment (Figure A.6).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table is important because it shows how AMIE&#39;s conversational abilities were tested in different clinically relevant situations. The prompts represent potential real-world applications of the AI, such as patient education, assisting general practitioners, and providing specialist consultations. By evaluating AMIE&#39;s performance in these scenarios, the researchers can assess its potential to improve communication, enhance decision-making, and increase access to specialized knowledge.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>Clinical Data Summary:</strong> The section presents a summary of the clinical data given to AMIE, including an echocardiogram and a Holter monitor report. This data serves as the basis for AMIE&#39;s assessment.</li><li><strong>AMIE&#39;s Response:</strong> The section showcases AMIE&#39;s response to the assessment form questions, covering areas like overall impression, consult question, triage assessment, diagnosis, management, and the impact of genetic test results.</li><li><strong>Illustrative Example:</strong> This example response allows readers to understand how AMIE processes clinical data and formulates its assessment, providing a concrete illustration of its capabilities.</li><li><strong>Contextual Reference:</strong> The section refers to Figure 3, which contains the assessment form questions, and Figure A.1, which visually presents the clinical data summary and AMIE&#39;s response.</li><li><strong>Focus on Practical Application:</strong> The example response demonstrates AMIE&#39;s practical application in a real-world clinical scenario, showcasing its potential as a diagnostic tool.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of AMIE&#39;s Response</strong>
        <p>The section clearly presents AMIE&#39;s response to the assessment form questions, making it easy for readers to understand how the AI analyzes clinical data and formulates its assessment.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figure A.1 | Example model response. a) Summaries of the clinical data provided to AMIE. b) The response provided by AMIE to the questions in Figure 3." (Page 19)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Inclusion of Clinical Data Summary</strong>
        <p>Providing the clinical data summary alongside AMIE&#39;s response allows readers to see the basis for the AI&#39;s assessment and understand its reasoning.</p>
        <div class="quote">"a) Summaries of the clinical data provided to AMIE." (Page 19)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Visual Presentation in Figure A.1</strong>
        <p>The visual presentation of the clinical data summary and AMIE&#39;s response in Figure A.1 enhances clarity and makes it easier to compare the input and output.</p>

    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Multiple Example Responses</strong>
        <p>Including only one example response might not fully represent the range of AMIE&#39;s capabilities and potential variations in its assessments. Providing multiple examples with different clinical scenarios would be more informative.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Multiple examples would offer a more comprehensive view of AMIE&#39;s performance and allow readers to assess its consistency and adaptability.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include 2-3 additional example responses with varying clinical presentations and complexities.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Compare AMIE&#39;s Response to a Gold Standard</strong>
        <p>While the example shows AMIE&#39;s response, it doesn&#39;t provide a comparison to a gold standard or expert assessment. Including an expert&#39;s assessment of the same case would allow readers to evaluate AMIE&#39;s accuracy and identify any discrepancies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Comparing AMIE&#39;s response to a gold standard would provide a benchmark for its performance and highlight areas where it aligns with or deviates from expert opinion.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include an expert&#39;s assessment of the same clinical case, highlighting any differences between the expert&#39;s and AMIE&#39;s assessments.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Reasoning Behind AMIE&#39;s Response</strong>
        <p>The section presents AMIE&#39;s response but doesn&#39;t explain the reasoning behind it. Providing insights into AMIE&#39;s decision-making process would enhance understanding and transparency.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the AI&#39;s reasoning process is crucial for building trust and evaluating the validity of its assessments.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences explaining the key factors that influenced AMIE&#39;s assessment, such as specific findings in the clinical data or relevant medical knowledge.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>

        <summary>figure A.1</summary>
        <p>Figure A.1 shows an example of AMIE&#39;s response to a clinical case. It&#39;s split into two parts: (a) Clinical Data Summary and (b) Example AMIE Response. Part (a) summarizes the important information from the patient&#39;s echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) and Holter monitor (a portable device that records heart rhythm). This summary is like a cheat sheet for the AI, giving it the key facts about the patient&#39;s heart structure and rhythm. Part (b) shows AMIE&#39;s answers to the questions on the assessment form (Figure 3). This is where AMIE gives its overall impression of the case, whether it thinks the patient has a genetic heart problem, what the diagnosis is, and how the patient should be managed. It&#39;s like AMIE&#39;s version of a doctor&#39;s report.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix section provides detailed results from the subspecialist evaluations, offering further insights into the evaluation process. It includes tables showing the preference ratings between AMIE and cardiologist responses, individual assessments of both, and the preference between cardiologist responses before and after accessing AMIE&#39;s responses.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Preference Rating between AMIE and Cardiologist Responses (Table A.1):</strong> This table shows the percentage of subspecialist preferences for AMIE, cardiologists, and ties across 10 domains, along with confidence intervals and the difference in preference percentages.</li><li><strong>Individual Assessment of AMIE and Cardiologist Responses (Table A.2):</strong> This table presents the proportion of &quot;yes&quot; responses for five individual assessment questions, comparing AMIE and cardiologist performance with confidence intervals and the difference in proportions.</li><li><strong>Preference between Cardiologist Responses With and Without AMIE Assistance (Table A.3):</strong> This table compares cardiologist responses before and after accessing AMIE&#39;s output, showing preferences for unassisted, assisted, and tie responses across 10 domains, with confidence intervals and the difference in preference percentages.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Breakdown of Results</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the subspecialist evaluations, including preference ratings, individual assessments, and the impact of AMIE assistance on cardiologist responses.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Here we present detailed results from subspecialist evaluators including: the preference between AMIE and cardiologist responses, the individual assessment of AMIE and cardiologist responses, and the preference between cardiologist responses with and without access to AMIE’s response." (Page 20)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Use of Confidence Intervals</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of confidence intervals in the tables provides a measure of uncertainty around the estimates, strengthening the statistical validity of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"(90% CI)" (Page 20)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Table Structure</strong>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Summary Statements for Each Table</strong>
        <p>While the tables present the data, adding a brief summary statement below each table would help readers quickly grasp the key findings and their significance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would improve the readability and accessibility of the results, making it easier for readers to interpret the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a concise summary sentence or two below each table highlighting the main findings and their implications.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain the Statistical Significance</strong>
        <p>While confidence intervals are provided, the section doesn&#39;t explicitly state the criteria for statistical significance. Clarifying this would enhance the interpretation of the results.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand which differences between AMIE and cardiologists, or between assisted and unassisted responses, are statistically significant.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence explaining the significance level used (e.g., alpha = 0.05 or 0.10) and how it was applied to the confidence intervals.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect the Results to the Main Text</strong>
        <p>The appendix could benefit from more explicit connections to the main text. For example, how do the detailed results presented here support or refute the claims made in the Results and Discussion sections?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would strengthen the integration of the appendix with the rest of the paper and help readers understand the significance of the detailed results in the broader context of the study.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a few sentences at the beginning or end of the section linking the presented data to specific findings or arguments in the main text.</p>

        <p>Table A.1 shows how often subspecialist cardiologists preferred AMIE&#39;s responses compared to general cardiologists&#39; responses across 10 different areas of assessment. Each area, like &#39;Overall Impression&#39; or &#39;Management,&#39; has percentages showing how often AMIE was preferred, how often the general cardiologist was preferred, and how often it was a tie. For example, for &#39;Overall Impression,&#39; AMIE was preferred 39.7% of the time, the cardiologist 32.4% of the time, and it was a tie 27.9% of the time. The table also shows the difference between AMIE and the cardiologist&#39;s preference percentages and a confidence interval (CI), which tells us how much these percentages might vary. If the difference is positive and the CI doesn&#39;t include zero, it means AMIE was significantly preferred in that area.</p>

        <summary>table A.3</summary>
        <p>Table A.3 compares cardiologists&#39; responses before and after they had access to AMIE&#39;s assessment. For each of the 10 domains (like &#39;Entire Response&#39; or &#39;Diagnosis&#39;), it shows the percentage of times the cardiologists&#39; initial responses (Unassisted), their revised responses after seeing AMIE&#39;s assessment (Assisted), and &#39;Tie&#39; (no clear preference) were chosen by subspecialist evaluators. It also shows the difference between the &#39;Assisted&#39; and &#39;Unassisted&#39; percentages. The table uses confidence intervals (CI) to show the range within which the true percentages likely fall. The key takeaway is that for all 10 domains, the &#39;Assisted&#39; responses were preferred more often than the &#39;Unassisted&#39; responses, showing that AMIE&#39;s input generally helped the cardiologists improve their assessments. In fact, for &#39;Entire Response&#39;, the assisted response was preferred a whopping 60.3% more often than the unassisted one!</p>

            <h3>Summary of subspecialist free-text comments for individual assessments</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix section summarizes the free-text comments provided by subspecialist cardiologists on the individual assessments of both AMIE and general cardiologists. These comments offer qualitative insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each, complementing the quantitative preference ratings. The comments were summarized using an LLM (Gemini 1.5 Flash) and are presented in Figure A.2, separated into blue boxes for cardiologist feedback and red boxes for AMIE feedback. The figure also includes the proportion of responses that received comments for each of the five assessment criteria: Extra Content, Omits Content, Correct Reasoning, Inapplicability for particular demographics, and Clinically Significant Errors.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Qualitative Insights:</strong> The free-text comments provide valuable qualitative insights into the subspecialists&#39; reasoning behind their preferences and evaluations, adding depth to the quantitative data.</li><li><strong>Comparison of AMIE and Cardiologists:</strong> The comments highlight the different strengths and weaknesses of AMIE and general cardiologists, such as AMIE&#39;s thoroughness versus the cardiologists&#39; conciseness.</li><li><strong>Focus on Individual Assessments:</strong> The comments specifically address the five individual assessment criteria, allowing for a granular analysis of different aspects of the responses.</li><li><strong>LLM-Generated Summaries:</strong> The use of Gemini 1.5 Flash to summarize the comments ensures conciseness and facilitates comparison between AMIE and cardiologists.</li><li><strong>Proportion of Responses with Comments:</strong> The inclusion of the proportion of responses with comments for each criterion provides context and transparency, acknowledging potential biases in the feedback.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Qualitative Enrichment</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of qualitative comments enriches the analysis by providing context and insights beyond the quantitative data.</p>
        <div class="quote">"LLM-generated summaries of the comments left by subspecialists for the AMIE and cardiologist individual assessments (Section A.3)." (Page 18)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Focus on Individual Criteria</strong>
        <p>Focusing on the individual assessment criteria allows for a more granular understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AMIE and cardiologists.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We took all free-text comments from subspecialists for each of the 5 questions in the individual assessment (Figure 5) and asked Gemini 1.5 Flash to summarize the feedback for the cardiologists (left, blue boxes) and for AMIE (right, red boxes)." (Page 22)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Transparency Regarding Comment Proportion</strong>
        <p>Providing the proportion of responses with comments for each criterion enhances transparency and acknowledges potential biases in the feedback.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Note that not every assessment received a comment from the subspecialists, and there is likely bias in which assessments they chose to comment on.

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Include Actual Comments</strong>
        <p>While summaries are helpful, including a selection of actual comments would provide richer context and allow readers to draw their own conclusions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would enhance the transparency and depth of the qualitative analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a representative sample of actual comments from subspecialists for each criterion, potentially in a supplementary table or as an online appendix.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Inter-rater Reliability</strong>
        <p>The section doesn&#39;t mention how agreement between subspecialists was assessed. Discussing inter-rater reliability would strengthen the validity of the qualitative analysis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would address potential concerns about the subjectivity of qualitative feedback and provide a measure of the consistency of the evaluations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Calculate and report a measure of inter-rater reliability, such as Cohen&#39;s kappa or Fleiss&#39; kappa, to assess the agreement between subspecialists on the individual assessment criteria.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect Qualitative Feedback to Quantitative Results</strong>
        <p>The section could more explicitly connect the qualitative feedback to the quantitative results presented in the main text. For example, how do the comments explain the observed differences in preference ratings between AMIE and cardiologists?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would strengthen the integration of the qualitative and quantitative analyses and provide a more comprehensive understanding of AMIE&#39;s performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing how the qualitative feedback aligns with or contradicts the quantitative results, highlighting any key insights or discrepancies.</p>

            <h3>Summary of Clinically Significant Errors</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix section summarizes the clinically significant errors made by both AMIE and general cardiologists, as identified by subspecialist reviewers. AMIE&#39;s errors tended to be related to over-testing and over-treatment, potentially due to an over-reliance on advanced technology. General cardiologists, on the other hand, were more prone to missing rarer diagnoses, conducting incomplete workups, and inadequately integrating genetic information into management plans, possibly reflecting a more conservative approach and less familiarity with rare conditions and guidelines.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Over-testing and Over-treatment by AMIE:</strong> AMIE frequently recommended unnecessary advanced tests and interventions, even when not clinically warranted, and prematurely suggested treatments before a definitive diagnosis.</li><li><strong>Misinterpretation of Genetic Information by AMIE:</strong> AMIE often misinterpreted genetic findings, such as mistaking carrier status for disease or misinterpreting variants of uncertain significance.</li><li><strong>Inaccurate Diagnoses and Management by AMIE:</strong> AMIE sometimes made incorrect diagnoses, especially in differentiating cardiomyopathies, and formulated inappropriate management plans.</li><li><strong>Limited Differential Diagnosis by Cardiologists:</strong> General cardiologists often failed to consider a broad range of diagnoses, particularly missing rarer conditions.</li><li><strong>Incomplete Workup and Follow-up by Cardiologists:</strong> Cardiologists tended to omit crucial investigations and inadequate follow-up, including genetic counseling and family screening.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Concise Summary of Errors</strong>
        <p>The section provides a clear and concise summary of the key error themes for both AMIE and cardiologists, making it easy to understand the main differences in their error profiles.</p>
        <div class="quote">"AMIE’s errors tended to be more related to over-testing, over-treatment, and misinterpretation of complex data, potentially reflecting a tendency to prioritize advanced technology over clinical judgment. The general cardiologist’s errors were more focused on incomplete workup, limited differential diagnosis, and inadequate follow-up, possibly suggesting a more conservative approach and a lack of familiarity with rarer conditions and the latest guidelines for genetic testing and management."

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Specific Examples</strong>
        <p>While the summary identifies key error themes, providing specific examples of these errors would enhance clarity and illustrate their clinical implications.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would make the error descriptions more impactful and help readers understand the potential consequences of these mistakes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include 1-2 specific examples for each error theme, illustrating the types of tests or treatments unnecessarily recommended by AMIE or the specific diagnoses missed by cardiologists.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Error Frequency</strong>
        <p>The summary describes the types of errors but doesn&#39;t quantify their frequency. Providing the number or percentage of each error type would provide a more complete picture of the error profiles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying error frequency would allow for a more precise comparison between AMIE and cardiologists and help assess the relative importance of different error types.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add information on the number or percentage of each error type made by AMIE and cardiologists, potentially in a table or within the summary text.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Potential Mitigation Strategies</strong>
        <p>The section could benefit from a brief discussion of potential strategies for mitigating these errors. For example, how could AMIE&#39;s tendency towards over-testing be addressed, or how could cardiologists be supported in considering a broader range of diagnoses?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing mitigation strategies would make the section more actionable and forward-looking, highlighting potential solutions for improving the performance of both AMIE and cardiologists.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing potential mitigation strategies, such as incorporating human oversight in AMIE&#39;s recommendations or providing cardiologists with access to decision support tools.</p>

AMIE&#39;s ability to explain rare conditions and recommend appropriate referrals could improve the quality and timeliness of care for patients with complex cardiac conditions.</p>

        <p>Figure A.6 presents a simulated dialogue between AMIE, acting as a subspecialist cardiologist, and a patient. AMIE explains the patient&#39;s test results, diagnoses noncompaction cardiomyopathy (a heart muscle condition), discusses treatment options (like medications to help the heart pump better and remove excess fluid), and addresses the patient&#39;s concerns about a fluttering feeling in their chest, identifying it as a potential heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia) detected by tests. The figure also includes a summary of the clinical data used in the simulation and feedback from a real subspecialist cardiologist on AMIE&#39;s performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "AMIE assumes the role of the specialist cardiologist and presents an assessment (Figure A.6)."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> For the remaining three hypothetical scenarios, AMIE was given a prompt, akin to a “one-line” summary of a patient (Table A.4) along with clinical data for the corresponding patient and asked to produce dialogues mirroring various potential use cases for AMIE: 1. AMIE reaches a diagnosis and then explains it to a patient (Figure A.4); 2. AMIE providing assistive dialogue for a general cardiologist (Figure A.5); 3. AMIE assumes the role of the specialist cardiologist and presents an assessment (Figure A.6).</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure demonstrates AMIE&#39;s potential to communicate complex medical information directly to patients in an understandable way. It also showcases AMIE&#39;s ability to synthesize information from multiple tests and provide a comprehensive assessment, mimicking the role of a subspecialist. This is relevant to the broader goal of democratizing access to specialized medical expertise.</p>
