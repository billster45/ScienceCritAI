        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research paper investigates the ability of humans and large language models (LLMs) to distinguish between human and AI-generated text in online conversations, using modified Turing tests called &quot;inverted&quot; and &quot;displaced&quot; tests. The study found that both humans and LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, performed poorly in identifying AI, even below chance levels in some cases, highlighting the challenges of AI detection in realistic online settings.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, acting as judges in an inverted Turing test, performed significantly worse than human interrogators in the original interactive Turing test and even below chance in identifying AI-generated text.</li><li>GPT-4 was frequently misidentified as human by both other AI models and displaced human judges, even more so than actual humans.</li><li>Displaced human judges, evaluating transcripts of Turing tests, also performed poorly in identifying AI, demonstrating the difficulty of AI detection in passive consumption scenarios.</li><li>In-context learning significantly improved GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy in the inverted Turing test, suggesting potential for improvement in AI-based detection methods.</li><li>Statistical AI detection methods, such as curvature, showed some promise but were not yet sufficiently accurate for real-world applications due to high variability in language generation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study employed a novel approach using modified Turing tests to investigate AI detection in more realistic, non-interactive settings, addressing limitations of traditional Turing tests.</li><li>The research included both human and AI judges, allowing for direct comparison of their performance and insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses in AI detection.</li><li>The study explored various factors that might influence AI detection accuracy, such as transcript length, AI witness performance, and the use of in-context learning for LLMs.</li><li>The research utilized a robust methodology, including pre-registered hypotheses, a well-defined sampling procedure, and thorough statistical analysis.</li><li>The study&#x27;s findings have significant implications for understanding the challenges of AI detection in online environments and the need for more accurate and reliable detection tools.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Further research could explore the reasons behind LLMs&#x27; misjudgments in more depth, potentially through qualitative analysis of their reasoning or examination of the features they focus on.</li><li>Investigating the impact of different prompting strategies on LLMs&#x27; performance in the inverted Turing test could reveal whether their accuracy can be improved through prompt engineering.</li><li>Future studies could address the potential confound of using different participant populations for the interactive and displaced Turing tests by directly comparing judges from the same population.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study demonstrates that both humans and current state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to reliably distinguish between human and AI-generated text in online conversations, especially in passive consumption scenarios. This has significant implications for AI detection in real-world online environments, where the ability to accurately identify AI is crucial for maintaining trust and combating misinformation. Future research should focus on developing more robust and reliable AI detection methods, potentially by combining different approaches such as LLMs, statistical analysis, and human judgment, and exploring the cognitive processes involved in human AI detection.</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This abstract summarizes a research study that investigated the ability of humans and large language models (LLMs) to distinguish between human and AI-generated text in online conversations. The study employed modified Turing tests, called &quot;inverted&quot; and &quot;displaced&quot; tests, using transcripts from interactive Turing tests. The results indicate that both AI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and displaced human judges performed poorly in identifying AI-generated text, even performing below chance levels. Notably, GPT-4 was frequently misidentified as human, even more so than actual humans. The study highlights the challenges of AI detection in realistic online settings and emphasizes the need for more accurate detection tools.</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Highlights key findings.</strong>
        <p>The abstract effectively summarizes the main results, emphasizing the poor performance of both AI and human judges in identifying AI-generated text and the surprising finding that GPT-4 was often perceived as more human than actual humans.</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clearly states the implications and future directions.</strong>
        <p>The abstract concludes by highlighting the challenges posed by these findings for AI detection and underscores the need for developing more accurate tools to address this issue.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;This suggests that both humans and current LLMs struggle to distinguish between the two when they are not actively interrogating the person, underscoring an urgent need for more accurate tools to detect AI in conversations.&quot;" (Page 1)</div>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Could benefit from a slightly more detailed description of the displaced Turing test.</strong>

        <div class="quote">"&quot;We measured how well people and large language models can discriminate using two modified versions of the Turing test: inverted and displaced.&quot;" (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For example, the abstract could include a sentence like: &quot;The displaced Turing test involved presenting human judges with transcripts of conversations from interactive Turing tests, requiring them to identify the AI without the ability to directly interact.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Could briefly mention the specific AI models used.</strong>
        <p>While the abstract refers to LLMs, it could explicitly name the specific models used (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to provide more context for readers familiar with these models.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section provides the background and context for the research study, introducing the concept of the Turing test and its variations. It discusses the limitations of traditional Turing tests in real-world scenarios where humans often passively consume AI-generated content without the opportunity for direct interaction. The section then introduces the inverted and displaced Turing tests as modifications that address these limitations and allow for investigating AI detection in more ecologically valid settings. It also briefly touches upon statistical AI detection methods as an alternative approach. Finally, the section outlines the specific research questions and goals of the present study, which aim to explore the accuracy of humans and LLMs in identifying AI-generated text in these modified Turing test scenarios.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>The Turing test serves as a measure of AI&#x27;s ability to imitate human conversation and deceive humans.</li><li>Traditional Turing tests provide interrogators with the advantage of real-time interaction and questioning.</li><li>Inverted Turing tests place AI in the role of the interrogator, assessing its ability to distinguish between humans and AI.</li><li>Displaced Turing tests involve human judges evaluating transcripts of Turing tests, simulating passive consumption of AI-generated content.</li><li>Statistical AI detection methods offer an alternative approach based on probabilistic signatures of LLM-generated text.</li><li>The present study aims to investigate the accuracy of humans and LLMs in identifying AI in displaced and inverted Turing test settings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Provides a clear and concise overview of the Turing test and its history.</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively explains the concept of the Turing test, its purpose, and its significance in the field of AI. It also briefly touches upon the historical context and debates surrounding the test.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;In 1950, Alan Turing devised the imitation game as a test to indirectly investigate the question, &#x27;Can machines think?&#x27;&quot;" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clearly articulates the limitations of traditional Turing tests and the need for modifications.</strong>
        <p>The introduction highlights the limitations of traditional Turing tests in capturing the real-world scenarios where humans often encounter AI-generated content without the opportunity for direct interaction. This justifies the need for exploring modified Turing test variations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;An ordinary Turing test provides the interrogator with a key advantage not always present in passive consumption of AI-generated text: they can adapt their questions to adversarially test the witness in real time.&quot;" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Introduces the inverted and displaced Turing tests as relevant modifications.</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively introduces the inverted and displaced Turing tests as variations that address the limitations of traditional tests and allow for investigating AI detection in more realistic settings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;Here, we ask how well human and AI judges perform without this advantage, when they only have access to a transcript of a Turing test interview conducted by a separate participant.&quot;" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clearly states the research questions and goals of the study.</strong>
        <p>The introduction concludes by outlining the specific research questions that the study aims to address, providing a clear direction for the subsequent sections.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;We conducted Turing test variations by sampling transcripts from a previously-run interactive Turing test (Jones and Bergen, 2023), and presenting them to displaced AI and human judges (Figure 1).&quot;" (Page 3)</div>

        <strong>Could expand on the discussion of statistical AI detection methods.</strong>
        <p>While the introduction briefly mentions statistical methods, it could provide a more detailed explanation of their underlying principles and how they differ from the Turing test approach. This would enhance the reader&#x27;s understanding of the broader landscape of AI detection techniques.</p>
        <div class="quote">"&quot;There exist a variety of statistical approaches to detecting AI-generated content.

        <strong>Could provide more context on the specific challenges and risks associated with AI impersonating humans.</strong>
        <p>The introduction mentions the risks associated with AI impersonation but could elaborate on the specific challenges and potential negative consequences of this phenomenon in online spaces. This would further emphasize the importance and urgency of the research.</p>

        <h3>Study 1: Inverted Turing Test</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section details Study 1, which focuses on evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to act as judges in an &#x27;inverted&#x27; Turing test. In this setup, the LLMs, referred to as &#x27;adjudicators&#x27;, are presented with transcripts from previous interactive Turing tests and tasked with determining whether the &#x27;witness&#x27; in the conversation is human or AI. The study investigates the accuracy of these LLMs in comparison to human interrogators from the original Turing tests and explores factors that might influence their judgments, such as the performance of different AI witnesses and the length of the conversation transcripts.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are used as adjudicators in an inverted Turing test.</li><li>The LLMs are presented with transcripts from interactive Turing tests conducted in a previous study.</li><li>The main goal is to assess the accuracy of LLMs in distinguishing between human and AI witnesses based on conversation transcripts.</li><li>The study investigates whether GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy is higher or lower than human accuracy, its ability to identify a specific well-performing GPT-4 witness, and its ability to distinguish between humans and the best GPT-4 witness.</li><li>The influence of transcript length and the comparison of GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy to GPT-3.5&#x27;s accuracy are also explored.</li><li>The results show that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform significantly worse than interactive human interrogators and even below chance levels in some cases.</li><li>The LLMs tend to misjudge AI witnesses, particularly the best-performing GPT-4 witness, as human more often than they misjudge human witnesses as AI.</li><li>Transcript length does not significantly affect the accuracy of GPT-4 or GPT-3.5.</li><li>GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy is not significantly different from GPT-3.5&#x27;s accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Clear research question and hypotheses.</strong>
        <p>The research question about LLMs&#x27; ability to act as Turing test judges is clearly stated, and the specific hypotheses regarding GPT-4&#x27;s performance are well-defined and testable. This provides a strong foundation for the study&#x27;s design and analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We first place GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the role of the evaluator in an inverted Turing test. Because the models are not actively interrogating the witness, we refer to this more passive role as the adjudicator. We presented both models with transcripts of previously-run Turing tests (Jones and Bergen, 2023) and elicited judgements about whether the witness was a human or an AI. We pre-registered 5 hypotheses on OSF." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-defined methodology.</strong>
        <p>The methods section provides a detailed description of the data source (transcripts from Jones and Bergen, 2023), the sampling procedure, the AI models used, and the prompting strategy. This allows for reproducibility and transparency.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We sampled 500 transcripts from Jones and Bergen (2023) who conducted more than 6,000 Turing tests with interactive human adjudicators. Our sample was constrained to ensure i) an equal number of human and AI witnesses, ii) the same proportion of games from the best-performing GPT-4 witness as the full dataset, and iii) an equal distribution of human and AI verdicts for the best-performing model. We presented the transcripts to two leading AI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), followed by a prompt that instructed models to make a judgement on whether the witness was a human or AI, to indicate a confidence level in the verdict, and to provide reasoning for judgements (Appendix A)." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Thorough analysis and reporting of results.</strong>
        <p>The results section presents a comprehensive analysis of the LLMs&#x27; performance, including comparisons to human interrogators, statistical significance testing, and specific findings related to different AI witnesses and transcript length. This allows for a clear understanding of the study&#x27;s findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We compared the accuracy of AI adjudicators to the verdicts of the interactive interrogators in the original experiment from which the transcript sample was drawn. We found that GPT-4, as an adjudicator in an inverted Turing test, was significantly less accurate than interactive human interrogators from the original Turing test experiment (z = 7.17, p &lt; 0.001). Interactive humans had an average accuracy (across witnesses) of 64.8%, while GPT-3.5 was accurate 31.4% of the time and GPT-4 was accurate 36.4% of the time. Of the AI-witnesses, one witness based on GPT-4 (GPT-4 (best)) had a pass rate of 50.9% in our sample of transcripts from the original study. For this best-performing AI witness, GPT-4’s adjudicator accuracy was significantly worse than chance at 29.1% (z = 3.00, p = 0.003)." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Explore the reasons behind LLMs&#x27; misjudgments.</strong>
        <p>While the study reports that LLMs struggle to distinguish between human and AI-generated text, it doesn&#x27;t delve deeply into the reasons behind these misjudgments. A qualitative analysis of the LLMs&#x27; reasoning or a more detailed examination of the features they focus on could provide valuable insights into their decision-making process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"These results suggest current LLM systems are poor at distinguishing between human and AI-generated content—even when they are evaluating content produced by the same underlying LLM." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For example, the researchers could analyze the &#x27;reasoning&#x27; provided by the LLMs in their JSON responses or use techniques like attention visualization to understand which parts of the transcripts the LLMs are focusing on when making their judgments.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate the impact of different prompting strategies.</strong>
        <p>The study uses a specific prompt to instruct the LLMs to make their judgments. However, different prompting strategies might influence the LLMs&#x27; performance. Exploring variations in the prompt, such as providing more explicit instructions or examples, could reveal whether the LLMs&#x27; accuracy can be improved through prompt engineering.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We presented the transcripts to two leading AI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), followed by a prompt that instructed models to make a judgement on whether the witness was a human or AI, to indicate a confidence level in the verdict, and to provide reasoning for judgements (Appendix A)." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The researchers could experiment with different prompts that provide more context about the Turing test, highlight specific features to look for, or encourage the LLMs to consider alternative perspectives.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider the limitations of using transcripts from a specific dataset.</strong>
        <p>The study relies on transcripts from a previous study by Jones and Bergen (2023). This might limit the generalizability of the findings, as the characteristics of the conversations and the performance of the AI witnesses in that dataset might not be representative of all Turing test interactions. Using transcripts from a more diverse range of Turing tests or generating new transcripts could strengthen the study&#x27;s external validity.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We sampled 500 transcripts from Jones and Bergen (2023) who conducted more than 6,000 Turing tests with interactive human adjudicators." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The researchers could either incorporate transcripts from other Turing test datasets or design new Turing test experiments with different parameters and AI models to create a more diverse set of transcripts for the LLMs to evaluate.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 2 is central to the results of Study 1, the Inverted Turing Test. It visually presents the key finding that AI adjudicators (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) judged GPT-4 witnesses to be human more often than they did real human witnesses. This highlights the difficulty that AI models have in distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, even when the AI is evaluating text generated by a similar model. The figure also shows that displaced human adjudicators had a similar pattern for the best GPT-4 witness, further emphasizing the challenge of AI detection in a non-interactive setting.</p>

The figure shows that transcript length did not have a significant effect on accuracy for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or Interactive Human adjudicators. However, it did have a negative effect on accuracy for Displaced Human adjudicators, suggesting that longer transcripts might be more difficult for humans to evaluate in a non-interactive setting.</p>

        <h3>Study 2: Displaced Turing Test</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section presents Study 2, which investigates the ability of humans to identify AI-generated text in a &#x27;displaced&#x27; Turing test scenario. Displaced human adjudicators are presented with transcripts from interactive Turing tests and asked to determine whether the witness is human or AI, mirroring the setup of Study 1 but with human judges instead of LLMs. The study aims to assess the accuracy of these displaced human judges in comparison to both interactive human interrogators and the AI adjudicators from Study 1, exploring factors like the performance of different AI witnesses and the impact of transcript length.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Displaced human adjudicators evaluate the same set of 500 transcripts used in Study 1.</li><li>The goal is to compare their accuracy to interactive human interrogators and AI adjudicators (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).</li><li>The study examines whether displaced humans can accurately identify the best-performing GPT-4 witness and whether they judge humans more accurately than this GPT-4 witness.</li><li>The influence of transcript length on adjudicator accuracy is also investigated.</li><li>Results show that displaced human adjudicators are significantly less accurate than interactive human interrogators but not significantly more accurate than the AI adjudicators.</li><li>The best-performing GPT-4 witness achieves a higher pass rate than human witnesses among displaced adjudicators.</li><li>Contrary to expectations, longer transcripts are associated with lower accuracy for displaced human adjudicators.</li><li>No significant correlations are found between adjudicator accuracy and demographic factors or attitudes towards AI.</li><li>Accuracy increases across trials, suggesting a learning effect despite the absence of feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Well-designed experimental setup.</strong>
        <p>The study effectively mirrors the design of Study 1, using the same set of transcripts and research questions but replacing the AI adjudicators with human judges. This allows for a direct comparison between the performance of humans and LLMs in a displaced Turing test scenario.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To investigate people’s accuracy in identifying AI systems in this more passive context, we mirrored the inverted Turing test study with humans—a design we call the displaced Turing test. Displaced human adjudicators evaluated the same sample of transcripts and made judgements about whether the witness was human or an AI." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive data collection and analysis.</strong>
        <p>The study collects data on adjudicator accuracy, confidence levels, and reasoning for each judgment. Additionally, exit survey questions explore demographic factors, attitudes towards AI, and self-reported strategies. This rich dataset allows for a multifaceted analysis of the factors influencing human performance in the displaced Turing test.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Human participants also indicated their confidence level and reasoning for each transcript (Appendix B). At the end of the study, participants were asked a series of debrief questions about the reasoning for their judgements, their methods, and their mental/emotional beliefs about AI (Appendix C). For analyses, we again used the lmertest package in R to fit linear mixed effects models." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Addresses potential confounds and limitations.</strong>
        <p>The study acknowledges the potential confound of using different participant populations for the interactive and displaced Turing tests. It also discusses the counterintuitive finding of a negative relationship between transcript length and accuracy, offering a plausible explanation based on the original study&#x27;s design.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It is important to note that the displaced adjudicators were recruited from a different population than the interactive interrogators, which could confound the insights we can draw about the effect of displacement per se." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Further investigate the impact of participant population.</strong>
        <p>While the study acknowledges the potential confound of different participant populations, it doesn&#x27;t actively address this issue. Future research could directly compare the performance of interactive and displaced judges from the same population to isolate the effect of displacement itself.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It is important to note that the displaced adjudicators were recruited from a different population than the interactive interrogators, which could confound the insights we can draw about the effect of displacement per se." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This could involve recruiting a new sample of participants and having them complete both the interactive and displaced Turing tests, or using a within-subjects design where the same participants complete both tasks in a counterbalanced order.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore the role of feedback and learning.</strong>
        <p>The study observes a learning effect across trials despite the absence of feedback. Future research could investigate whether providing feedback after each judgment enhances learning and improves accuracy. This could shed light on the mechanisms underlying human improvement in AI detection tasks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Accuracy increased across trials, suggesting that participants learned across the experiment in spite of a lack of feedback (z = 2.05, p = 0.041)." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This could involve different feedback conditions, such as providing the correct answer, highlighting specific features that distinguish human and AI text, or offering personalized advice based on the participant&#x27;s performance.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Analyze the qualitative data on reasoning.</strong>
        <p>The study collects data on participants&#x27; reasoning for their judgments but doesn&#x27;t provide a detailed analysis of this qualitative information. A systematic analysis of the reasons cited by participants, particularly for misjudgments, could reveal valuable insights into the cognitive processes involved in human AI detection.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Many participants reported their methods changed from checking for formality or grammar to assessing inappropriate uses of slang, excessive informality, or consistency in grammar as indicative of AI witnesses (OSF)." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This could involve coding the participants&#x27; free-text responses into categories based on the types of features they focus on (e.g., grammar, content, style, emotional tone) and analyzing the frequency and accuracy of these categories across different witness types and judgment outcomes.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure is crucial for understanding the main findings of Study 2, the Displaced Turing Test. It directly shows that displaced human adjudicators, similar to AI adjudicators in Study 1, were less accurate at identifying AI witnesses, particularly the best-performing GPT-4 witness, compared to interactive human interrogators. This supports the argument that the ability to actively interrogate a witness is crucial for accurate AI detection.</p>

        <h3>Additional Analyses</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section delves into additional analyses conducted to further explore the findings from the inverted and displaced Turing tests. It investigates the impact of in-context learning (ICL) on GPT-4&#x27;s performance as an adjudicator, analyzes the reasoning provided by different adjudicator types, and evaluates the effectiveness of statistical AI detection methods in identifying AI-generated text within the Turing test transcripts.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>In-context learning (ICL) is explored by presenting GPT-4 with transcripts serially, allowing it to retain previous transcripts and judgments in its memory.</li><li>ICL significantly improves GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy to 58%, matching the accuracy of displaced human adjudicators.</li><li>Reason analyses using GPT-4o reveal similar reasoning patterns across different adjudicator types, with &#x27;unnatural responses&#x27; being the most common reason for AI judgments.</li><li>Statistical AI detection methods, specifically log likelihood and curvature, are applied to the transcripts.</li><li>Log likelihood shows a general trend of higher likelihood for AI-generated text, but the best-performing GPT-4 witness has a similar likelihood to human witnesses.</li><li>Curvature proves more effective, with human witnesses having significantly lower curvature than AI witnesses, achieving an overall accuracy of 69%.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Investigates the impact of in-context learning.</strong>
        <p>The section explores the potential for LLMs to improve their performance through in-context learning, a crucial aspect of LLM capabilities that was not addressed in the initial inverted Turing test. This provides valuable insights into how LLMs can learn from previous examples and adapt their judgments accordingly.</p>
        <div class="quote">"One key difference between the displaced human experiment and the inverted experiment was that human adjudicators completed 50 transcripts in series, while LLM adjudicators were presented each transcript separately. Although human participants were not provided with feedback after each trial, serial presentation may have allowed them to learn more about the distribution of transcripts and even markers of individual AI witnesses which were represented multiple times (supported by the increase in accuracy across trials, see Figure 10). In order to determine whether similar in-context learning (ICL) dynamics could influence AI adjudicators’ performance, we conducted an analogous experiment, presenting transcripts serially to the model." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Analyzes the reasoning behind judgments.</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply reporting accuracy scores and delves into the reasoning provided by different adjudicator types. This qualitative analysis, facilitated by GPT-4o, reveals interesting similarities and differences in the features that humans and LLMs focus on when making their judgments.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In order to evaluate the kinds of reasons that different adjudicators cite for their decisions, we used GPT-4o to classify reasons from each verdict using the classification scheme provided by Jones and Bergen (2023)." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explores alternative AI detection methods.</strong>
        <p>The section acknowledges the limitations of relying solely on LLMs as judges and explores the potential of statistical AI detection methods. This broadens the scope of the study and provides a more comprehensive evaluation of different approaches to AI detection.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To investigate whether statistical AI-detection tools could outperform human and AI adjudicators in judging Turing test transcripts, we implemented two methods from Mireshghallah et al. (2024), who achieve 90% accuracy in identifying GPT-4-generated content." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more details on the ICL implementation.</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions presenting transcripts serially to GPT-4, it lacks specific details about the ICL implementation. Information about the number of transcripts used for ICL, the order of presentation, and any specific instructions or prompts provided to GPT-4 during ICL would enhance the reproducibility and clarity of this analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We randomly sampled 50 transcripts from the full set, and presented them to GPT-4. After each transcript was presented, the transcript—alongside GPT-4’s verdict, confidence, and reasoning—was retained in the set of messages presented to the model." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The authors could include a table or supplementary material outlining the exact sequence of transcripts used for ICL, the specific prompts provided to GPT-4 at each step, and any variations in the ICL procedure. This would allow other researchers to replicate the experiment and explore the impact of different ICL parameters.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Expand the discussion of the limitations of statistical methods.</strong>
        <p>The section briefly mentions the limitations of statistical methods, particularly the issue of false positives. However, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the challenges and ethical implications of using these methods in real-world scenarios. This would provide a more balanced perspective on the potential and limitations of statistical AI detection.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Nevertheless, this level of accuracy would be impractical for real-world problems where false positives could lead to negative outcomes for real human users (Chaka, 2024)." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The authors could discuss the potential consequences of false positives in different contexts, such as social media platforms or online education. They could also explore the trade-offs between accuracy and other factors, such as fairness, bias, and the potential for adversarial attacks. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations involved in deploying AI detection systems.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on future research directions for combining different approaches.</strong>
        <p>The section suggests exploring interactions between different AI detection tools. This could be further developed by outlining specific research questions and methodologies for combining LLMs, statistical methods, and human judgment in a complementary manner. This would provide a roadmap for future research aimed at developing more robust and reliable AI detection systems.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Studies may also explore interactions between these tools, assessing, for example, whether access to AI verdicts influences displaced verdicts, or visa versa." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The authors could propose specific research designs, such as hybrid systems that combine LLM judgments with statistical analysis or interactive systems that allow human judges to leverage AI-generated insights. They could also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of each approach, outlining specific research questions and methodologies for evaluating their effectiveness.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 4 is crucial for understanding the qualitative aspects of the adjudicators&#x27; decision-making processes. It provides insights into the types of features that both AI and human adjudicators focus on when determining whether a text is AI-generated or human-written.

        <h3>General Discussion</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section synthesizes the findings from both Study 1 (Inverted Turing Test) and Study 2 (Displaced Turing Test), discussing their implications for understanding AI&#x27;s capacity for naive psychology and the challenges of AI detection in real-world scenarios. It revisits Watt&#x27;s criteria for passing the inverted Turing test, comparing the performance of GPT-4 and displaced human adjudicators. The section also highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between human and AI-generated text in passive consumption contexts, emphasizing the potential for well-designed AI systems to successfully impersonate humans online. Finally, it discusses the promise and limitations of statistical AI detection methods, advocating for further research into more robust and reliable approaches.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Neither GPT-4 nor displaced human adjudicators consistently outperform each other in terms of accuracy, suggesting that AI systems do not yet possess naive psychology comparable to humans.</li><li>Displaced human adjudicators and GPT-4 exhibit low agreement on their verdicts, indicating that their decision-making processes differ despite similar accuracy levels.</li><li>The best-performing GPT-4 witness consistently achieves higher pass rates than human witnesses in both inverted and displaced Turing tests, highlighting the potential for AI to convincingly impersonate humans in online interactions.</li><li>Statistical AI detection methods, particularly curvature, show promise but are not yet sufficiently accurate for real-world applications due to high variability in language generation.</li><li>The section advocates for further research into combining different AI detection approaches, including LLMs, statistical methods, and human judgment, to develop more robust and reliable detection systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Connects findings to the concept of naive psychology.</strong>
        <p>The section effectively links the study&#x27;s results to the theoretical framework of naive psychology, discussing whether AI systems exhibit a human-like ability to attribute mental states to others. This connection adds depth to the interpretation of the findings and positions the research within a broader cognitive science context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Watt’s criterion for passing the inverted Turing test is that a machine perform on par with human evaluators. If human evaluators can differentiate between humans and a particular AI, an AI adjudicator should succeed as well. If humans cannot differentiate, then the machine should fail." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Highlights the real-world implications of the findings.</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply reporting experimental results and discusses the practical implications of the findings for AI detection in online environments. It emphasizes the challenges posed by the increasing sophistication of AI systems and the potential for them to deceive humans in passive consumption contexts.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The displaced Turing test appears to be more challenging than the interactive test, but this variation is also likely to occur more frequently in everyday life. As many online conversations are now public—on forums, social media platforms, and group chats—an interaction between any two users is likely to be read by a much wider group who don’t have the opportunity to directly interrogate potential bots." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Advocates for a multi-faceted approach to AI detection.</strong>
        <p>The section recognizes the limitations of individual AI detection methods and advocates for a more comprehensive approach that combines the strengths of different techniques. This includes integrating LLMs, statistical methods, and human judgment to develop more robust and reliable detection systems.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Future work should investigate a wider variety of statistical approaches to understand whether alternative methods could be more applicable for short informal conversations. Both adjudicators appeared to do better with some form of learning, as we saw displaced human accuracy increase over trials and GPT-4 accuracy increase with ICL. Future research should empirically assess whether exposure improves displaced accuracy." (Page 8)</div>

        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Deepen the discussion of the ethical implications.</strong>
        <p>While the section briefly mentions the potential for negative outcomes from false positives in AI detection, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the ethical implications of AI impersonation and the use of AI detection systems. This would enhance the societal relevance of the research and encourage responsible development and deployment of these technologies.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Nevertheless, this level of accuracy would be impractical for real-world problems where false positives could lead to negative outcomes for real human users (Chaka, 2024)." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The authors could discuss the potential for AI impersonation to be used for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, manipulating individuals, or eroding trust in online communication. They could also explore the ethical considerations of using AI detection systems, such as the potential for bias, discrimination, and privacy violations. This would encourage a more critical and nuanced understanding of the societal impact of these technologies.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more concrete examples of future research directions.</strong>
        <p>The section suggests several avenues for future research, but these suggestions could be more concrete and actionable. Providing specific research questions, methodologies, and potential datasets would make these suggestions more valuable for guiding future investigations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Studies may also explore interactions between these tools, assessing, for example, whether access to AI verdicts influences displaced verdicts, or visa versa." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For example, the authors could propose specific research designs for investigating the interaction between LLMs and statistical methods, such as developing hybrid systems that combine both approaches or exploring how LLMs can be used to improve the accuracy of statistical methods. They could also suggest specific datasets or tasks that would be suitable for evaluating these hybrid systems. This would provide a more tangible roadmap for future research and encourage the development of more sophisticated AI detection methods.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the limitations of the current study in more detail.</strong>
        <p>While the section acknowledges the confound of different participant populations, it could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the study&#x27;s limitations. This would enhance the transparency and rigor of the research and provide a more balanced perspective on the generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Limitations and Future Research The interactive Turing test study was not run on the same population of participants as the displaced Turing test, so comparisons are between different populations and may be confounded by demographic and motivational factors." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The authors could discuss other potential limitations, such as the specific characteristics of the Turing test transcripts used, the limited number of AI models evaluated, and the potential for bias in the statistical detection methods. They could also discuss how these limitations might affect the interpretation of the findings and suggest ways to address them in future research. This would enhance the scientific rigor of the study and provide a more nuanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
