        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on &quot;cross-capabilities,&quot; which are combinations of individual skills like reasoning, coding, and tool use required for complex, real-world tasks. Current LLM evaluations often assess these skills in isolation, overlooking the crucial interplay between them. The study introduces CrossEval, a benchmark designed to assess both individual and cross-capabilities using a diverse set of human-annotated prompts and an LLM-based evaluator. The key finding reveals a &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; phenomenon, where an LLM&#39;s performance on cross-capability tasks is predominantly limited by its weakest individual skill, highlighting the need for balanced capability development. This has significant implications for LLM training and deployment, suggesting that focusing solely on maximizing individual strengths may not translate to effective real-world performance.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Law of the Weakest Link:</strong> LLM performance on tasks requiring multiple skills is bottlenecked by the weakest individual skill involved. This was measured using the CrossEval benchmark, which showed that even when an LLM excelled in one area, its performance on a combined task was significantly lower if it had a weakness in another required skill. For example, an LLM strong in reasoning but weak in tool use performed poorly on tasks requiring both. This finding implies that balanced skill development across all relevant capabilities is crucial for real-world LLM effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Tool Use as a Major Challenge:</strong> Across various LLMs, tool use emerged as a particularly weak capability. This was observed through consistently lower scores on tool-use-related tasks in CrossEval. The implications are significant as tool use is crucial for many practical applications, such as information retrieval and interacting with external systems. Future LLM development needs to prioritize improving tool use capabilities for better real-world performance.</li><li><strong>Improving Weak Skills Yields Greater Gains:</strong> Targeted improvements in weaker individual skills led to more substantial improvements in cross-capability performance compared to enhancing already strong skills. This was demonstrated by using principle-based system prompting to boost specific capabilities and observing the impact on combined tasks. This finding reinforces the importance of focusing on bolstering weak areas for optimal LLM development.</li><li><strong>CrossEval Effectively Differentiates LLMs:</strong> The CrossEval benchmark demonstrated its ability to distinguish between different LLMs based on their individual and cross-capability performance. The benchmark&#39;s detailed categorization of skills and tasks allowed for fine-grained analysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses, enabling developers to target improvements more effectively. This structured approach to LLM evaluation is crucial for comparing models and guiding future development.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction of Cross-Capabilities:</strong> The paper clearly defines and emphasizes the importance of cross-capabilities, addressing a gap in current LLM evaluation practices that predominantly focus on individual skills. This shift towards evaluating combined skills is essential for assessing real-world LLM performance.</li><li><strong>Well-Designed Benchmark:</strong> CrossEval offers a robust and comprehensive benchmark with diverse tasks, difficulty levels, and a systematic taxonomy of individual and cross-capabilities. The use of human-annotated prompts and responses ensures high-quality evaluation data, while the LLM-based evaluator enhances scalability.</li><li><strong>Controlled Skill Enhancement:</strong> The use of principle-based system prompting allows for targeted improvement of individual LLM capabilities, enabling a controlled investigation into how these changes affect cross-capability performance. This method provides valuable insights into the interplay between different skills.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploring Synergy and Compensation:</strong> While the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; is a significant finding, future research should investigate potential synergistic effects or compensatory mechanisms between LLM capabilities. For example, can a strength in one area partially offset a weakness in another? This would involve designing experiments to analyze how different combinations of strengths and weaknesses interact and influence overall performance.</li><li><strong>Detailed Analysis of Tool Use Challenges:</strong> The paper identifies tool use as a critical weakness but lacks a detailed analysis of the specific difficulties. Future research should investigate the types of tool use problems (understanding instructions, accessing tools, interpreting results) and their root causes. This would require analyzing error patterns in tool use tasks and developing targeted diagnostic tests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This research makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM evaluation by introducing the concept of cross-capabilities and the CrossEval benchmark. The study reveals a &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; phenomenon, demonstrating that an LLM&#39;s effectiveness in complex tasks is limited by its weakest individual skill, even when other skills are strong. This highlights the critical need for future research to focus on balanced capability development rather than solely maximizing individual strengths. Future work should investigate potential synergistic effects between capabilities and develop targeted strategies for improving weaker areas, especially in critical domains like tool use. CrossEval can serve as a valuable tool for researchers and developers to assess and improve LLM performance for real-world applications, paving the way for more robust and versatile LLMs capable of handling complex, multifaceted tasks.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on their individual capabilities, such as reasoning or coding. However, real-world tasks often require a combination of skills, which this paper terms &quot;cross capabilities.&quot; The research introduces CrossEval, a benchmark designed to assess both individual and cross capabilities in LLMs. The key finding is that LLM performance on cross-capability tasks is limited by the weakest individual capability, a phenomenon referred to as the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link.&quot; This means that even if an LLM excels in one area, its performance on a complex task will be dragged down if it&#39;s weak in another required skill. The paper emphasizes the importance of identifying and improving these weaker capabilities for better real-world performance.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Cross Capabilities:</strong> The paper introduces the concept of cross capabilities, which are combinations of individual LLM skills needed for complex tasks. An example would be needing both tool use (like web browsing) and reasoning to answer a question about recent trends.</li><li><strong>CrossEval Benchmark:</strong> A new benchmark called CrossEval is presented. It&#39;s designed to test both individual skills (like English, coding, reasoning) and cross capabilities (combinations of skills). It uses human-annotated prompts and responses to evaluate LLMs.</li><li><strong>Law of the Weakest Link:</strong> The central finding is that an LLM&#39;s performance on tasks requiring multiple skills is held back by its weakest individual skill. Like a chain being only as strong as its weakest link, an LLM&#39;s overall performance is limited by its weakest area.</li><li><strong>Tool Use Challenge:</strong> The research identifies tool use (like using web browsers or code interpreters) as a particularly weak area for current LLMs, highlighting the need for improvement in this area.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Introduction of Cross Capabilities</strong>
        <p>The paper clearly defines and motivates the concept of cross capabilities, highlighting its importance for real-world LLM applications. This provides a valuable contribution to the field by focusing on a previously overlooked aspect of LLM evaluation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities. However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-designed Benchmark</strong>
        <p>The CrossEval benchmark appears to be thoughtfully constructed, with a focus on diverse tasks and difficulty levels. The use of human-annotated prompts and responses, along with the development of an LLM-based evaluator, enhances the reliability and scalability of the evaluation process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Further Investigation of Synergy and Compensation</strong>
        <p>While the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; is a significant finding, it would be beneficial to explore whether any synergy or compensatory mechanisms exist between LLM capabilities. For example, could a strength in one area partially compensate for a weakness in another?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the interplay between different capabilities could lead to more effective strategies for LLM development. Knowing if strengths can compensate for weaknesses would be valuable.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct further experiments to analyze how different combinations of strong and weak capabilities affect overall performance. This could involve manipulating individual capabilities and observing the impact on cross-capability tasks.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>More Detailed Analysis of Tool Use Challenges</strong>
        <p>The paper identifies tool use as a major challenge, but a more in-depth analysis of the specific difficulties LLMs face in this area would be helpful. What types of tool use are most problematic? Are the issues related to understanding instructions, accessing tools, or interpreting results?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A deeper understanding of the specific challenges in tool use would allow researchers to develop more targeted solutions. Knowing the root causes of the problems is essential for effective improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the CrossEval results for tool use tasks in more detail. Categorize the errors made by LLMs and identify common patterns. This could involve examining the types of tools used, the complexity of the tasks, and the specific errors made by the models.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for a research paper exploring how the combination of different skills, or &quot;cross capabilities,&quot; in Large Language Models (LLMs) impacts their performance. It points out that current evaluations often focus on individual skills, like coding or reasoning, separately. However, real-world tasks often require multiple skills working together. The paper introduces a new benchmark, CrossEval, to test these combined skills and investigates how a weakness in one skill can affect performance on complex tasks.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Individual vs. Cross Capabilities:</strong> The paper distinguishes between individual capabilities (single skills like reasoning) and cross capabilities (combinations of skills like reasoning and tool use). It argues that real-world tasks often demand cross capabilities.</li><li><strong>CrossEval Benchmark:</strong> CrossEval is introduced as a new benchmark designed to evaluate both individual and cross capabilities in LLMs. It uses human-annotated prompts and responses to assess performance.</li><li><strong>Law of the Weakest Link:</strong> The introduction hints at the paper&#39;s main finding: an LLM&#39;s performance on complex tasks is often limited by its weakest individual skill, similar to how a chain&#39;s strength is determined by its weakest link.</li><li><strong>Real-world Relevance:</strong> The paper emphasizes that cross capabilities are essential for real-world tasks, making their evaluation crucial for LLM development.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Motivation</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively motivates the research by highlighting the gap between current LLM evaluation practices (focusing on individual skills) and the demands of real-world tasks (requiring combined skills). This clearly establishes the need for the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have predominantly centered on individual capabilities. However, can all real-world tasks be adequately categorized under just one capability, or do they frequently demand the seamless integration of multiple skills, thereby challenging the prevalent approach to evaluating these advanced LLMs?" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Relatable Examples</strong>
        <p>The use of concrete examples, like the question about rainfall trends in Tokyo, makes the concept of cross capabilities easy to understand. These examples help readers grasp the practical implications of the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Consider a user prompt asking, “Which direction has the total rainfall in Tokyo, Japan been trending over the past 10 years? Explain it step by step.” Such a task requires the integration of tool use (web browsing) with analytical reasoning." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the Chosen Capabilities</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions seven core individual capabilities, briefly explaining why these specific capabilities were chosen would strengthen the introduction. Are these the most common skills required in real-world applications? Do they represent a diverse range of LLM functionalities?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Justifying the selection of capabilities would increase the reader&#39;s confidence in the benchmark&#39;s comprehensiveness and relevance.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief explanation of the criteria used to select the seven core capabilities. This could involve referencing existing research or datasets that highlight the importance of these skills.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Preview the Structure of the Paper</strong>
        <p>Providing a brief overview of the paper&#39;s structure at the end of the introduction would help readers navigate the content and understand how the research questions are addressed. This would improve the overall flow and readability.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clear roadmap of the paper&#39;s structure helps readers anticipate the content and follow the logical progression of the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a short paragraph outlining the main sections of the paper and the key questions addressed in each section. This could be as simple as stating, &quot;The rest of the paper is organized as follows...&quot; followed by a brief description of each section.</p>

            <h3>Defining Individual &amp; Cross Capabilities in LLMs</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explains how the research paper categorizes the skills of Large Language Models (LLMs), both individually and in combination. It defines seven core individual capabilities, like English language proficiency and coding skills. Then, it explains how these individual skills are paired to represent common combined skills needed for real-world tasks, called &quot;cross capabilities.&quot; The paper creates a structured system (a taxonomy) to organize these skills and the specific tasks they enable, much like organizing animals into different species and families.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Individual Capabilities:</strong> Seven core individual skills are defined, including English, Reasoning, Coding, Image Recognition, Tool Use, Long Context, and Spanish. These are considered fundamental skills for LLMs.</li><li><strong>Cross Capabilities:</strong> These are combinations of two individual capabilities, like Coding &amp; Reasoning or Tool Use &amp; Reasoning. They represent the need for LLMs to use multiple skills at once.</li><li><strong>Taxonomy:</strong> A hierarchical structure is used to organize these capabilities. It starts with broad categories (like &quot;Reasoning&quot;) and then breaks them down into more specific tasks (like &quot;Mathematical Calculation&quot; or &quot;Moral &amp; Ethical Reasoning&quot;).</li><li><strong>Real-World Focus:</strong> The chosen capabilities and their combinations are meant to reflect the kinds of tasks LLMs encounter in real-world applications.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Definitions</strong>
        <p>The section provides clear definitions of individual and cross capabilities, making it easy to understand how the researchers categorize LLM skills. This clarity is essential for interpreting the results of the benchmark.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Real-world interactions with LLMs encompass tasks that may require either an individual capability or the simultaneous engagement of distinct skills. To effectively evaluate LLMs, defining and differentiating these capabilities is crucial." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Systematic Organization</strong>
        <p>The use of a taxonomy to organize the capabilities and tasks provides a structured and systematic approach to LLM evaluation. This helps ensure comprehensive coverage of different skills and their combinations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As illustrated in Figure 1, these taxonomies follow a hierarchical design: the root node represents either an individual or cross capability, with the next two layers (Level-1 and Level-2 categories) breaking these down into increasingly specific tasks." (Page 3)</div>

        <strong>Provide More Concrete Examples of Cross-Capability Tasks</strong>
        <p>While the section defines cross capabilities, providing more specific examples of the tasks within each cross capability would enhance understanding. For example, what does a &quot;Coding &amp; Reasoning&quot; task look like in practice?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would make the concept of cross capabilities more tangible and relatable for readers.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a few example tasks for each cross capability, illustrating how the two individual skills are combined. For instance, a &quot;Coding &amp; Reasoning&quot; task could involve debugging code based on error messages and logical deduction.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain the Rationale Behind Choosing Spanish</strong>
        <p>The section includes Spanish as an individual capability and in some cross capabilities. Briefly explaining why Spanish was chosen as the representative multilingual capability would be helpful. Was it based on prevalence, data availability, or other factors?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Justifying the choice of Spanish would strengthen the paper&#39;s methodology and address potential questions about language selection.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining the rationale for selecting Spanish. This could involve stating that Spanish was chosen due to its wide usage or its relevance to a particular application area.</p>

            <h3>CrossEval Benchmark Construction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the creation of CrossEval, a benchmark to assess the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring both individual and combined skills (cross capabilities). It explains how the prompts were designed, how multiple model responses were collected and rated by humans, and how an LLM was trained to act as an evaluator, mimicking human judgment.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Prompt Set Annotation:</strong> Prompts were carefully created to cover different skill categories and difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.</li><li><strong>Multiple References with Human Annotations:</strong> Instead of a single correct answer, multiple LLM responses were collected for each prompt. Human experts then rated these responses and provided explanations, acknowledging that many open-ended tasks have multiple valid solutions.</li><li><strong>LLM-based Evaluator:</strong> An LLM was trained to evaluate responses by learning from the human-rated examples. This allows for automated and scalable evaluation of LLM performance.</li><li><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> The LLM evaluator was refined through multiple rounds of training and feedback, improving its agreement with human judgments.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Addressing Real-World Prompt Quality</strong>
        <p>The paper acknowledges the issue of low-quality prompts in real-world scenarios and takes steps to ensure the quality and difficulty of the prompts in CrossEval. This makes the benchmark more realistic and relevant.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Previous research has shown that real-world user prompts can include a large number of low-quality inputs, making it difficult to differentiate between advanced models (Li et al., 2024). Additionally, constructing prompts with a high level of difficulty is inherently challenging (Padlewski et al., 2024)." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Multiple References and Human Explanations</strong>
        <p>Using multiple model responses and human explanations for each prompt addresses the open-ended nature of many tasks and the difficulty of defining a single &quot;correct&quot; answer. This approach provides a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Given these challenges, we propose using multiple model responses, scored and explained by human annotators, to serve as references for evaluation." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Annotator Training Process</strong>
        <p>While the paper mentions iterative refinement of the annotation guidelines, providing more details about the annotator training process would strengthen the methodology. How were annotators trained to use the Likert scale and provide consistent explanations?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Clearer explanation of annotator training would increase confidence in the reliability and consistency of the human annotations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Describe the specific training materials and procedures used to familiarize annotators with the task, the scoring criteria, and the desired format for explanations. This could include example prompts and responses with detailed annotations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Evaluation Metrics</strong>
        <p>While the LLM-based evaluator shows promising results, exploring alternative evaluation metrics could provide additional insights. Metrics that consider aspects like creativity, reasoning depth, or factual accuracy could complement the Likert scale ratings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Relying solely on a Likert scale might not capture all aspects of LLM performance, especially for complex tasks. Exploring other metrics could provide a more holistic evaluation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate the use of metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or BERT-based similarity scores to assess different aspects of LLM responses. Consider developing metrics specifically designed to measure cross-capability performance.</p>

            <h3>Exploring Relationship between Individual and Cross Capabilities</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section investigates how individual LLM capabilities influence their performance on tasks requiring multiple skills (cross capabilities). Using the CrossEval benchmark, the research reveals that LLMs often follow the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link,&quot; meaning their performance on combined tasks is limited by their weakest individual skill. For example, an LLM might be great at reasoning but struggle with tool use. When faced with a task requiring both, its overall performance will be closer to its tool use skill level than its reasoning skill level. The section also highlights that tool use is currently a major challenge for LLMs and that they generally underperform on cross-capability tasks compared to individual ones.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Law of the Weakest Link:</strong> LLM performance on cross-capability tasks is primarily determined by the weakest individual skill involved. This is analogous to a chain being only as strong as its weakest link.</li><li><strong>CrossEval Benchmark Results:</strong> The CrossEval benchmark effectively differentiates between various LLMs and reveals consistent underperformance on cross-capability tasks.</li><li><strong>Tool Use Challenge:</strong> Tool use emerges as the most challenging individual capability for current LLMs, significantly impacting their performance on related cross-capability tasks.</li><li><strong>Underperformance in Cross Capabilities:</strong> Even when controlling for task difficulty, LLMs tend to score lower on tasks requiring multiple skills compared to those requiring only a single skill.</li><li><strong>Evaluator Agnostic Results:</strong> The &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; effect is observed regardless of which LLM is used as the evaluator, suggesting it&#39;s a general characteristic of current LLMs.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot;</strong>
        <p>The paper clearly explains and demonstrates the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; effect in LLMs, providing a valuable insight into how individual capabilities interact. The analogy to a chain&#39;s strength makes the concept easy to grasp.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Notably, we find that in all cases where a distinct strong and weak capability is present, cross-capability performance either matches or slightly underperforms the weaker capability. This indicates that performance on tasks requiring multiple abilities is significantly constrained by the weakest component, a phenomenon closely aligned with the “Law of the Weakest Link (Liebig, 1840).&quot;" (Page 11)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Analysis of CrossEval Results</strong>
        <p>The section provides a thorough analysis of the CrossEval results, highlighting key findings related to the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; and the challenges in tool use. The use of density plots and specific examples strengthens the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As shown in Figure 3, the “Law of the Weakest Link” effect holds true regardless of the evaluator used. With GPT-4o, the density peaks slightly below the weaker capability, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows a slight peak above it. However, in both cases, performance clusters closely around the weaker capability." (Page 11)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate Strategies for Mitigating the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot;</strong>
        <p>While identifying the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot; is important, the paper could benefit from discussing potential strategies to mitigate this effect. How can LLMs be trained to better integrate different skills and avoid being limited by their weakest area?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding how to overcome the limitations imposed by the weakest link is crucial for improving LLM performance on complex tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explore different training approaches, such as multi-task learning or curriculum learning, that focus on developing a more balanced skill set. Investigate techniques for encouraging LLMs to leverage their strengths to compensate for weaknesses.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Specific Recommendations for Improving Tool Use</strong>
        <p>The paper highlights the challenges in tool use but doesn&#39;t offer concrete recommendations for improvement. What specific steps can researchers take to enhance LLM capabilities in this area?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specific recommendations would provide actionable guidance for researchers working on improving LLM tool use capabilities.</p>

            <h3>How Individual-Capability Alterations Impact Cross-Capability Performance?</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section investigates how changing an LLM&#39;s individual skills affects its performance on tasks requiring multiple skills (cross-capabilities). Using a method called principle-based system prompting, the researchers boosted specific skills and observed the impact. They found that improving a weaker skill leads to more significant gains in cross-capability performance than improving an already strong skill. This reinforces the &quot;Law of the Weakest Link,&quot; showing that even after targeted improvements, an LLM&#39;s performance on complex tasks is still largely determined by its weakest area.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Principle-Based System Prompting:</strong> This method uses principles (like rules or guidelines) to guide the LLM&#39;s behavior, focusing on improving a specific skill. It&#39;s like giving a student targeted study tips for a particular subject.</li><li><strong>Case Study:</strong> The researchers tested two LLMs (Claude 3 Haiku and Gemini 1.5 Flash) on three cross-capability tasks. They chose these models and tasks because they showed large differences between strong and weak individual skills, making the effects of improvement more noticeable.</li><li><strong>Impact of Altering Weak vs. Strong Capabilities:</strong> Improving a weaker skill had a bigger positive impact on cross-capability performance than improving an already strong skill. It&#39;s like focusing on fixing the biggest holes in a leaky bucket first.</li><li><strong>Continued &quot;Law of the Weakest Link&quot;:</strong> Even after improving individual skills, the LLMs&#39; performance on combined tasks was still mostly limited by their weakest remaining skill. This shows that balanced skill development is crucial.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Targeted Skill Enhancement</strong>
        <p>The principle-based system prompting method allows for targeted improvement of specific LLM capabilities. This provides a controlled way to investigate how individual skill changes affect cross-capability performance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To reliably explore the impact of altering single capabilities, we aim to enhance a specific capability without significantly affecting others. This allows for more controlled and precise investigation into cross-capability performance dynamics." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Different Prompting Methods</strong>
        <p>While principle-based prompting is effective, exploring other prompting methods for skill enhancement could be beneficial. Different methods might be more effective for certain skills or LLMs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Different prompting techniques might have varying strengths and weaknesses. A broader exploration could lead to more effective skill improvement strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate alternative prompting methods, such as few-shot learning or providing explicit examples of desired behavior. Compare the effectiveness of different methods across various skills and LLMs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Long-Term Effects of Skill Enhancement</strong>
        <p>The study focuses on the immediate effects of skill improvement. Investigating the long-term effects and whether the improvements generalize to other tasks would be valuable.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Knowing whether skill improvements are retained over time and transfer to new tasks is crucial for practical applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct follow-up experiments to assess LLM performance on cross-capability tasks after a period of time. Test the LLMs on new tasks that require the improved skills to see if the improvements generalize.</p>
