        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This study investigated the impact of incorporating a detraining period into a resistance training (RT) program on muscle strength and size development in untrained adults. Two groups were compared: a periodic resistance training (PRT) group, which underwent 10 weeks of training, 10 weeks of rest, and another 10 weeks of training, and a continuous resistance training (CRT) group, which trained for 20 weeks after an initial 10-week control period. Muscle strength and size were measured using one-repetition maximum (1RM) tests and ultrasound imaging, respectively. The study aimed to determine if short-term detraining negatively affects long-term muscle gains. The results showed that both groups achieved similar overall improvements, suggesting that planned breaks in training don&#39;t hinder long-term progress.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Similar overall gains in muscle strength and size were observed in both PRT and CRT groups despite the 10-week detraining period in PRT. This was measured using 1RM tests for leg press and bicep curl, and ultrasound measurements of vastus lateralis and biceps brachii cross-sectional area (CSA). Quantitatively, both groups increased their 1RM and muscle CSA by similar percentages, with no statistically significant difference between groups at the end of the study. This finding is important because it suggests that incorporating planned breaks into a training program does not necessarily hinder long-term muscle growth or strength development, which is valuable information for recreational weightlifters and athletes.</li><li>The PRT group experienced a decrease in both muscle strength and size during the detraining period. Muscle size decreased more substantially (approximately 8-10%) than strength (approximately 4-6%). These decreases were statistically significant compared to their pre-detraining values. This demonstrates that a break from training, even in relatively untrained individuals, leads to some loss of muscle adaptations. This reduction is consistent with previous research showing that muscle size is more sensitive to detraining than strength. This distinction is relevant because it suggests that different physiological processes may govern the loss of size versus strength during detraining.</li><li>Upon resuming training, the PRT group rapidly regained lost muscle and strength, reaching their previous peak levels within the first 5 weeks of retraining. In fact, they experienced greater gains during those initial 5 weeks compared to the CRT group during the equivalent training phase. This rapid regain, measured by 1RM and muscle CSA, provides evidence for &quot;muscle memory&quot;, a phenomenon where prior training adaptations are regained faster than they were initially acquired. This effect is potentially mediated by factors like increased myonuclei (muscle cell nuclei) or epigenetic modifications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study used a randomized, controlled design, which reduces the likelihood of biases and allows for a fair comparison between the two training groups. This strengthens the internal validity of the study and allows for causal inferences about the effects of the training interventions.</li><li>The study employed objective and reliable measures of muscle strength (1RM testing) and size (ultrasound imaging) to assess training adaptations. These standardized measurements reduce subjectivity and improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the findings.</li><li>The study included a control group, which helped isolate the effects of the resistance training interventions. By comparing the training groups to a non-training control group, the researchers could determine if the observed changes were due to the training or other factors.</li><li>The study controlled for total training volume load, ensuring that any differences between groups were not simply due to variations in the amount of work performed. This strengthens the causal link between the training schedule (continuous vs. periodic) and the observed outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>While the study measured muscle strength and size, it did not assess functional performance. Including functional tests, such as measures of power, endurance, or balance, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of detraining on real-world physical abilities. Future studies should consider incorporating such functional assessments.</li><li>The study did not control for dietary intake, which could influence muscle growth and strength development. Future research should consider controlling for dietary intake or assessing dietary patterns to determine if nutritional factors play a role in detraining and retraining responses. This could involve providing standardized meals or tracking participants&#39; food intake.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significant Elements</h3>
        
    <div>
        <h4>Figure 4</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 4 visually depicts the changes in muscle strength and size over time in both the PRT and CRT groups. It clearly shows the initial gains during the first training phase, the decrease during detraining in the PRT group, and the subsequent regain during retraining. This figure is essential for visualizing the key finding that PRT leads to similar overall gains as CRT despite the detraining period.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure directly supports the main conclusion by illustrating the similar long-term adaptations in both groups.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h4>Figure 5</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 5 provides a detailed view of the changes in muscle strength and size during specific 5-week periods within the training blocks. It highlights the rapid regain in the PRT group during the first 5 weeks of retraining, supporting the concept of &quot;muscle memory&quot;.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure strengthens the finding of rapid regain after detraining and provides further evidence for the muscle memory phenomenon.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study demonstrated that incorporating a 10-week detraining period into a resistance training program does not hinder long-term muscle strength and size gains in untrained adults. Participants who underwent periodic training regained lost muscle and strength rapidly upon resuming training, suggesting a &quot;muscle memory&quot; effect. While muscle size decreased more than strength during detraining, both were effectively regained within a few weeks of retraining. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms of muscle memory and investigate the effects of detraining and retraining on functional performance and different populations. These findings have practical implications for recreational weightlifters, suggesting that occasional training breaks of up to 10 weeks can be incorporated without significantly compromising long-term progress, as long as training is resumed consistently and effectively.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This study compared the effects of periodic resistance training (PRT) with breaks, and continuous resistance training (CRT) without breaks, on muscle strength and size in untrained adults. Fifty-five participants were split into two groups. The PRT group did 10 weeks of training, 10 weeks of rest, and another 10 weeks of training.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction emphasizes the importance of skeletal muscle for overall health and its adaptability to resistance training (RT). It highlights the benefits of RT, such as increased muscle size and strength, improved insulin sensitivity, body composition, and quality of life. However, it also acknowledges that these gains can be lost with discontinued training. The introduction then introduces the concept of muscle memory, suggesting that regaining lost muscle mass and strength might be faster after a period of detraining. Finally, it sets the stage for the current study, which aims to compare the effects of continuous RT versus periodic RT with a detraining period.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Muscle Importance:</strong> Skeletal muscle is crucial for health and function, adapting to demands like resistance training.</li><li><strong>Resistance Training Benefits:</strong> RT offers numerous health benefits beyond muscle growth, including improved insulin sensitivity, body composition, and quality of life.</li><li><strong>Muscle Loss After Training Cessation:</strong> Stopping RT leads to a decline in muscle strength and size, the extent of which depends on the detraining period&#39;s length.</li><li><strong>Muscle Memory:</strong> Previous research suggests that prior RT adaptations can be regained more quickly after detraining, possibly due to mechanisms like increased myonuclei.</li><li><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> This study aims to compare continuous RT with periodic RT (including a detraining period) to understand the impact of training breaks on muscle adaptations.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Context and Rationale</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the importance of skeletal muscle and the benefits of resistance training, providing a strong rationale for the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Skeletal muscle and its maintenance are essential for health and function and have a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental demands [1]." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concise Explanation of Detraining Effects</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly explains the negative consequences of training cessation on muscle strength and size, setting the stage for the study&#39;s investigation of periodic training.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Unfortunately, skeletal muscle plasticity is also shown after a training break. If RT is discontinued, the adaptations in muscle strength and size will start to decline and, depending on the length of the detraining period, can even be fully diminished." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Introduction of Muscle Memory Concept</strong>
        <p>The introduction briefly introduces the concept of muscle memory, which is relevant to the study&#39;s comparison of continuous and periodic training.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Fortunately, several studies have shown that RT adaptations in muscle size and strength, once achieved with RT, can be obtained faster with subsequent retraining if the initial adaptations were lost after detraining [10–16]." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Study&#39;s Hypothesis</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions the study&#39;s aim, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the hypothesis being tested.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clear hypothesis statement would strengthen the introduction and provide a more focused direction for the reader.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence stating the study&#39;s hypothesis, for example, &quot;We hypothesized that continuous resistance training would lead to greater increases in muscle strength and size compared to periodic resistance training with a detraining period.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Detail on Previous Research</strong>
        <p>While the introduction cites several studies, briefly summarizing the key findings of relevant studies on continuous and periodic training would provide more context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Several studies have shown that RT adaptations [...] can be obtained faster with subsequent retraining [...] [10–16]" (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed overview of previous findings would strengthen the background and justify the current study&#39;s design.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a few sentences summarizing the findings of key studies, focusing on the effects of detraining and retraining on muscle adaptations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Significance of the Study</strong>
        <p>The introduction could be strengthened by explicitly stating the potential implications of the study&#39;s findings for practical training recommendations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Highlighting the potential impact of the research would make the study more compelling and relevant to readers.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining how the study&#39;s findings could inform training practices, for example, &quot;The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the optimal training strategies for maximizing muscle growth and strength, particularly for individuals who may need to incorporate breaks in their training routines.&quot;</p>

        <strong>Clear Explanation of Study Design</strong>
        <p>The study design, including the randomization process and the rationale for the chosen approach, is clearly explained, allowing readers to understand the study&#39;s structure.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This study was a randomized, parallel-group repeated-measures design, and the purpose of the study was to compare the effects of PRT and CRT on adaptations in muscle strength and size in untrained young male and female adults." (Page 2)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Precise Measurement Protocols</strong>
        <p>The section provides detailed descriptions of the procedures for measuring muscle strength and size, including equipment, participant positioning, and image analysis techniques.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps brachii (BB) muscle CSA (cm2) were measured using a B-mode axial plane ultrasound (model SSD-α10; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with a 10 MHz linear-array probe (60 mm width) in extended-field-of-view mode (23 Hz sampling frequency)."

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Sample Size Justification</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions the target sample size, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed justification for the chosen number of participants, including a power analysis if conducted.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Fifty-five eligible males and females volunteered to participate in the study." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would strengthen the study&#39;s methodological rigor and allow readers to assess the adequacy of the sample size.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a statement explaining the sample size calculation, such as, &quot;A sample size of N was determined based on a power analysis with X% power to detect a Y% difference in muscle size between groups.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Detail on Randomization Procedure</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions random assignment, it would be helpful to describe the specific method used for randomization (e.g., computer-generated sequence, stratified randomization).</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to PRT or CRT." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would enhance the transparency and replicability of the study&#39;s methodology.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence specifying the randomization method, for example, &quot;Participants were randomly assigned to either the PRT or CRT group using a computer-generated random number sequence.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Include Information on Blinding</strong>
        <p>If applicable, the section should mention whether any blinding procedures were implemented (e.g., blinding of assessors to group allocation). If blinding was not possible, this should be acknowledged and the reasons explained.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Information on blinding is important for assessing the potential for bias in the study&#39;s results.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence addressing blinding, for example, &quot;Assessors were blinded to participant group allocation to minimize bias in the measurement of muscle strength and size.&quot; or &quot;Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and trainers was not possible.&quot;</p>
    </li>

        <summary>table TABLE 1</summary>
        <p>Table 1 provides a structured guideline for adjusting weekly training loads based on the number of repetitions achieved in the maximum repetition sets for five different exercises: Leg Press, Knee Extension, Smith Machine Bench Press, Biceps Curl, and Chest-Supported Seated Row. The table uses ranges of repetitions performed (e.g., &#39;&lt;5&#39;, &#39;6-7&#39;, &#39;8-10&#39;, etc.) to determine whether the load should be increased or decreased for the following week. For instance, if someone performs fewer than 5 repetitions in their maximum set of leg press, the load should be reduced by 7.5 kg the next week. Conversely, if they perform more than 20 repetitions, the load should be increased by 10 kg. This table is crucial for personalizing the training program and ensuring progressive overload while minimizing the risk of injury or overtraining.</p>

            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "A more detailed description of the training load adjustments is shown in Table 1."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> The number of repetitions was then used to adjust the training loads for the following week. If the number of performed repetitions was more than 10, the loads were increased, and if the repetitions were less than eight, the load was decreased. A more detailed description of the training load adjustments is shown in Table 1. Every fifth week, the second training session was replaced with the 1RM tests, which resulted in a decreased total volume load during those weeks and, therefore, also served as a small volume deload. All training sessions were conducted at the faculty laboratory, and the sessions were instructed and supervised by a trainer to ensure correct training techniques.</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table is essential for understanding how the training loads were adjusted throughout the study. It demonstrates the practical application of the progressive overload principle, a fundamental concept in resistance training where the stimulus is gradually increased to promote continuous adaptation. By providing specific load adjustments based on repetition performance, the table ensures that the training is tailored to each individual&#39;s progress, maximizing gains while minimizing the risk of plateaus or injuries.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of the study, starting with the confirmation that 10 weeks of resistance training (RT) effectively increases muscle size and strength. It then reveals that there were no significant differences in adaptations between the periodic resistance training (PRT) group (with a detraining period) and the continuous resistance training (CRT) group. Both groups showed similar improvements in muscle strength, size, and countermovement jump height. The PRT group did experience a decrease in muscle size and strength during the detraining period, but these losses were regained within the first 5 weeks of retraining, with even greater gains observed compared to the CRT group during the same timeframe.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>RT Effectiveness:</strong> 10 weeks of RT significantly improved muscle strength, size, and jump height, validating the training protocol.</li><li><strong>No Difference Between PRT and CRT:</strong> Despite the training break, the PRT group achieved similar overall gains in strength and size as the CRT group over the 20-week training period.</li><li><strong>Training Volume Load Similarity:</strong> The total training volume load was comparable between PRT and CRT, ensuring that differences in outcomes were not due to variations in training load.</li><li><strong>Detraining Effects:</strong> The PRT group experienced a decrease in muscle strength and size during detraining, with a more pronounced effect on muscle size.</li><li><strong>Rapid Regain During Retraining:</strong> The PRT group quickly regained lost muscle mass and strength during the first 5 weeks of retraining, even surpassing the gains of the CRT group during the equivalent training phase.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of Key Findings</strong>
        <p>The results are presented in a logical and organized manner, starting with the effectiveness of the RT protocol and then focusing on the comparison between PRT and CRT.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Both groups increased (p &lt; 0.001) their 1RM in leg press and biceps curl, muscle CSA in VL and BB, and CMJ height" (Page 6)</div>

        <strong>Detailed Statistical Reporting</strong>
        <p>The section provides detailed statistical information, including p-values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals, allowing readers to assess the significance and magnitude of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"leg press (ES; PRT: 0.90, CRT: 1.01) and biceps curl (ES; PRT: 1.01, CRT: 0.86), muscle CSA in VL (ES; PRT: 0.79, CRT: 0.76) and BB (ES; PRT: 0.66, CRT: 0.71), and CMJ height (ES; PRT: 0.60, CRT: 0.50)" (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Inclusion of Relevant Data</strong>
        <p>The section includes data on training volume load, ensuring that differences in outcomes are not attributed to variations in training load between groups.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The total training volume load [...] did not differ between the groups (PRT: 862 275 ± 187 295 kg vs. CRT: 891 115 ± 183 946 kg, p = 0.618)" (Page 6)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Visual Representation of Results</strong>
        <p>While the text descriptions are clear, including figures or graphs would enhance the presentation and make it easier for readers to visualize the changes over time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Visualizations can effectively communicate complex data and improve the overall readability of the results section.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Create line graphs showing the changes in muscle strength and size for both PRT and CRT groups over the course of the study. Include error bars representing standard deviations or confidence intervals.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>More Detailed Discussion of Detraining Effects</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions the decrease in muscle strength and size during detraining, it would be beneficial to provide a more in-depth analysis of these changes, including the magnitude of the decreases and their statistical significance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"After the 10-week detraining period, there was a significant decrease from the first RT period in leg press 1RM (-5.4% ± 4.4%, p &lt; 0.001), biceps curl 1RM (-3.6% ± 6.8%, p = 0.023), VL CSA (-9.9% ± 4.1%, p &lt; 0.001), BB CSA (-7.3% ± 3.9%, p &lt; 0.001), and CMJ height (-6.9% ± 5.3%, p &lt; 0.001)" (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed analysis of the detraining effects would provide a clearer understanding of the impact of the training break.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the description of the detraining effects, providing specific percentage decreases and p-values for each variable. Consider adding a table summarizing these changes.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comparison to Baseline Values</strong>
        <p>While the section focuses on changes relative to the first training period, it would be helpful to also compare the post-detraining and post-retraining values to the baseline (pre-training) values.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Comparing to baseline values would provide a more complete picture of the overall training effects and the extent of regain after detraining.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a comparison of the post-detraining and post-retraining values to the baseline values for each variable. This could be done in the text or by adding a column to the suggested table in the previous suggestion.</p>

    <details class="non-text-element">
        <summary>TABLE 2</summary>
        <p>Table 2 presents data on muscle strength, size, and countermovement jump (CMJ) height at baseline and after a 10-week intervention period. It compares a 10-week resistance training (10RT) group to a non-training control group. The table shows the average starting values (baseline) and the values after 10 weeks for several measurements. These measurements include how much weight participants could lift once (1RM) in a leg press and bicep curl, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of their vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps brachii (BB) muscles (think of CSA as the area of a slice of muscle, like the end of a sausage), and how high they could jump (CMJ). The table also shows the percentage change (Δ%) from baseline to week 10 for each measurement. It also includes a statistical comparison (Group x Time interaction) to see if the changes over time were different between the two groups. An asterisk (*) marks values that are statistically different from baseline, meaning the change is likely not due to random chance.</p>
        
        <div class="first-mention">
            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "We found a significant group-by-time interaction favoring 10 weeks of RT (p &lt; 0.001) in leg press 1RM, biceps curl 1RM, VL CSA, BB CSA, and CMJ height (Table 2)."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> To first understand whether the present 10 weeks of RT increases performance and muscle size, we compared 10-week RT to a similar length control period (see Figure 1). We found a significant group-by-time interaction favoring 10 weeks of RT (p &lt; 0.001) in leg press 1RM, biceps curl 1RM, VL CSA, BB CSA, and CMJ height (Table 2). No significant sex-by-time interactions (p ≥ 0.192) were observed for the leg press and biceps curl 1RM, VL and BB CSA, or CMJ.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table is important because it shows the effectiveness of a 10-week resistance training program. By comparing the training group to a control group, it demonstrates that the changes in muscle strength, size, and jump height are likely due to the training and not just random variation or other factors. This helps establish that the training program used in the study is effective at producing positive changes.</p>

        <summary>FIGURE 3</summary>
        <p>Figure 3 shows the total weekly training volume load (in kilograms) for both the periodic resistance training (PRT) and continuous resistance training (CRT) groups over the 30-week study period. Training volume load is a way to measure how much total weight was lifted each week. It&#39;s calculated by multiplying the number of sets, repetitions per set, and the weight lifted. The figure uses a line graph, where the x-axis represents time (in weeks) and the y-axis represents the weekly volume load. The PRT group&#39;s data is shown in blue, and the CRT group&#39;s data is in red. You&#39;ll notice dips in the lines every 5 weeks; these dips occur because strength tests replaced one of the regular training sessions those weeks, reducing the overall volume load. The graph also shows the different phases of the study: Control/No-RT, RT1 (first 10-week training period), DT/No-RT (detraining period), and RT2 (second 10-week training period).</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Our sample size calculations are based on earlier studies in our laboratory indicating that 10-20 participants per group are sufficient for between-group comparison of 10RT and control in both muscle size and strength [28, 29] with the power of 80% and two-tailed p &lt; 0.05, thus allowing a potential detraining effect to be investigated. To limit possible problems with statistical power, a large sample size as feasible for the current study setting was adopted to account for potential missing data. Normality of the data was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test. Between-group differences were examined with a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using sex and baseline values as a covariate. Within-group comparisons were examined with repeated measures ANOVA. In post hoc analysis, t-tests were used with correction for multiple testing by Holm-Bonferroni method [30]. Within-group effect sizes (ES) were calculated by the following formula: mean change divided by the sum of pre- and postvalues divided by 2. Percentage changes were calculated by the following formula: (postvalue minus prevalue) divided by prevalue and multiplied by 100. Between-group differences from the physical activity questionnaires were examined with independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test and within-group comparisons were examined with related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 28.0, IBM Corp) and Microsoft Excel (version 2406), and figures were made with GraphPad Prism software (version 10.0, GraphPad Software Inc). 3 | Results 3.1 | Ten Weeks of RT Increases Muscle Size and Strength To first understand whether the present 10 weeks of RT increases performance and muscle size, we compared 10-week RT to a similar length control period (see Figure 1). We found a significant group-by-time interaction favoring 10 weeks of RT (p &lt; 0.001) in leg press 1RM, biceps curl 1RM, VL CSA, BB CSA, and CMJ height (Table 2). No significant sex-by-time interactions (p ≥ 0.192) were observed for the leg press and biceps curl 1RM, VL and BB CSA, or CMJ. 3.2 | No Differences in the Adaptations Between PRT and CRT 3.2.1 | Training Load The total training volume load (Sets x Repetitions Per Set x Loads) during the 20 weeks of RT did not differ between the groups (PRT: 862 275 ± 187 295 kg vs. CRT: 891 115 ± 183 946 kg, p = 0.618) (Figure 3). Both groups increased the training volume load from the first 10-week training block to the second 10-week training block (p &lt; 0.001), and there was no significant difference between the groups in the volume load in the first (p = 0.893) or in the second 10-week training block (p = 0.424) or increases from the first to second 10-week block (PRT, 18% ± 10% vs. CRT, 23% ± 11%, p = 0.116). Every 5 weeks, we also calculated the relative training loads from the 1RM tests. There was no difference between the groups in the average relative training load for the 20 weeks of RT in leg press (PRT, 81.1% ± 3.9% vs. CRT, 82.6% ± 3.7%, p = 0.220) or biceps curl (PRT, 62.7% ± 5.3% vs. CRT, 63.7 ± 3.9, p = 0.464).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure is important because it visually demonstrates that the total training volume load was similar between the PRT and CRT groups over the 20-week training period. This helps control for a potential confounding variable: if one group had done significantly more work, it would be difficult to isolate the effect of the training schedule (continuous vs. periodic) on the outcomes. By showing similar volume loads, the researchers can be more confident that any differences in muscle strength and size are due to the training schedule itself.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This study found that a 10-week break from resistance training (detraining) did not negatively impact overall muscle strength and size gains compared to continuous training over 20 weeks. Participants who took a break regained their lost muscle mass and strength quickly, especially in the first few weeks after resuming training. This suggests that occasional breaks from training, up to 10 weeks, won&#39;t necessarily hinder long-term progress in untrained individuals. The study also found that muscle size decreases more than strength during detraining.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>No Long-Term Detraining Effect:</strong> A 10-week detraining period did not prevent participants from achieving similar strength and size gains as those who trained continuously.</li><li><strong>Rapid Regain of Muscle:</strong> Participants regained lost muscle mass and strength rapidly upon resuming training, particularly in the first 5 weeks.</li><li><strong>Muscle Size vs. Strength Loss:</strong> Muscle size decreased more significantly than strength during the detraining period.</li><li><strong>Muscle Memory:</strong> The rapid regain of muscle and strength suggests a potential muscle memory effect, allowing for faster re-adaptation to training.</li><li><strong>Practical Implications:</strong> Occasional training breaks of up to 10 weeks may not be detrimental for recreational weightlifters, as long as training is consistent and effective when performed.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear and Concise Summary of Findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings of the study in a clear and accessible way, highlighting the key takeaway that detraining did not negatively impact long-term gains.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this study, we showed that 10 weeks of detraining did not compromise RT adaptations in hypertrophy, maximal strength, or vertical jump performance when PRT was compared to an equal amount of CRT in young untrained males and females." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Effective Linking of Results to Previous Research</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively connects the study&#39;s findings to previous research on detraining and retraining, providing context and supporting the conclusions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The observation that PRT and CRT similarly improved muscle strength and size aligns with previous findings on the topic [4, 17, 18]." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discussion of Practical Implications</strong>
        <p>The discussion goes beyond simply reporting the results and explores the practical implications of the findings for recreational weightlifters, offering valuable insights for training practices.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Therefore, while continuity of training is an important fundamental principle in physical activity, our results suggest that recreational RT practitioners should not be too concerned about an occasional 10-week training break." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Further Exploration of Muscle Memory Mechanisms</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions muscle memory, it could be strengthened by delving deeper into the potential underlying mechanisms, such as myonuclear number, epigenetic modifications, or neural adaptations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Proposed underlying mechanisms for skeletal muscle memory have been an increased number of myonuclei and epigenetic modifications that are perceived after training breaks [32]." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of the mechanisms would provide a more complete understanding of the observed rapid regain phenomenon.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion on muscle memory by incorporating more recent research and exploring the relative contributions of different mechanisms.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Limitations More Explicitly</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions some limitations (e.g., lack of nutrition control), it would be beneficial to address these limitations more directly and discuss their potential impact on the study&#39;s findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study limitations were lack of nutrition control, CMJ height was used to evaluate lower body power production, but a similar test for the upper body was not conducted, and no other test was used to measure functional capacity in daily activities." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more explicit discussion of limitations would strengthen the study&#39;s rigor and transparency.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Devote a separate paragraph to discussing the study&#39;s limitations and their potential influence on the results. Explain how future research could address these limitations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Alternative Explanations for Rapid Regain</strong>
        <p>While muscle memory is a plausible explanation for the rapid regain, the discussion could be enhanced by considering alternative explanations, such as resensitization of muscle to training stimuli after a break.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, the changes during the first 5 weeks of retraining were not greater compared to the initial 5 weeks of RT and, thus, it remains unclear if the greater rate of gains in PRT compared to the CRT group was due to muscle memory or just resensitization of muscle after the training break [34]." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Exploring alternative explanations would demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the findings and encourage critical thinking.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a paragraph discussing alternative explanations for the rapid regain, such as resensitization, and discuss how future research could differentiate between these possibilities.</p>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Specify the Types of Supporting Information</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions supporting information, it would be more helpful to briefly list the types of materials available online (e.g., tables, figures, datasets, code).</p>
        <div class="quote">"Additional supporting information can be found online in the Supporting Information section." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specifying the types of supporting information would give readers a better understanding of what to expect and make it easier for them to find the information they need.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Replace the current text with a more specific description, such as, &quot;Supporting information including supplementary tables, figures, and the study dataset can be found online.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide a Direct Link or DOI</strong>
        <p>Including a direct link or DOI to the online supporting information would make it much easier for readers to access.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Additional supporting information can be found online in the Supporting Information section." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A direct link or DOI would eliminate the need for readers to search for the supporting information, improving accessibility and user experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a direct link or DOI to the online supporting information after the current text, for example, &quot;DOI: [insert DOI here]&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Briefly Describe Key Supplementary Materials</strong>
        <p>If space permits, briefly describing the most important supplementary materials would further enhance the section.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Additional supporting information can be found online in the Supporting Information section." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Highlighting key supplementary materials would give readers a better understanding of the scope and depth of the supporting information and encourage them to access it.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief description of key supplementary materials, such as, &quot;Key supplementary materials include a detailed breakdown of the training program and a comprehensive analysis of individual participant responses.&quot;</p>
