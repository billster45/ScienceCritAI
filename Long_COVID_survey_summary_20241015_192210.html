They analyzed the prevalence of long COVID symptoms at various time points after infection and investigated the relationship between long COVID and factors like age, gender, region, acute illness severity, underlying diseases, vaccination status, and reinfection. The researchers used statistical methods like multinomial logistic regression and propensity score matching to adjust for confounding variables and identify significant associations.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Participant Recruitment and Ethical Considerations:</strong> The study recruited 74,075 participants from across China using an online questionnaire distributed through a referral system. Ethical approval was obtained, and participants provided informed consent before completing the survey.</li><li><strong>Questionnaire Design and Content:</strong> The questionnaire was adapted from the Symptom Burden Questionnaire for Long COVID (SBQ-LC) and included questions about demographics, vaccination status, underlying diseases, SARS-CoV-2 infection history, other pathogen infections, and long COVID symptoms. Participants were asked to report details for their first and most recent infections.</li><li><strong>Data Quality Control:</strong> The researchers implemented a rigorous quality control process to ensure data reliability. This involved removing duplicate questionnaires, excluding responses with inconsistent or contradictory information, and filtering out questionnaires with unreasonable completion times or symptom reporting.</li><li><strong>Symptom Statistics and Severity Assessment:</strong> Long COVID was defined as the persistence or onset of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, lasting for at least two months. Symptom severity was assessed using a four-point scale (non-symptomatic, slightly symptomatic, obviously symptomatic, and severely symptomatic). The researchers excluded the &quot;slightly symptomatic&quot; category from the final analysis to minimize bias.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> The researchers used multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with long COVID, adjusting for potential confounders. Propensity score matching was employed to balance baseline characteristics between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups for comparative analysis.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Questionnaire</strong>
        <p>The questionnaire covered a wide range of relevant topics, including demographics, vaccination status, underlying diseases, SARS-CoV-2 infection history, other pathogen infections, and long COVID symptoms. This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough investigation of potential risk factors and contributing factors to long COVID.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The survey covered various topics, including region of residence, sex, age, COVID-19 vaccination status, underlying diseases, smoking and drinking habits, SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 diagnosis methods, other pathogen infections, COVID-19’s impact on other diseases and long COVID symptoms, etc." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Rigorous Quality Control Measures</strong>
        <p>The researchers implemented a detailed and stringent quality control process to ensure data reliability. This involved multiple steps to identify and remove duplicate questionnaires, inconsistent responses, and potentially unreliable data. This rigorous approach strengthens the validity of the study&#39;s findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We eliminated invalid questionnaires through a systematic filtering process to improve reliability." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Appropriate Statistical Analysis</strong>
        <p>The researchers used appropriate statistical methods, including multinomial logistic regression and propensity score matching, to analyze the data and adjust for potential confounding variables. This analytical approach allowed for a robust investigation of the relationships between various factors and long COVID.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To identify long COVID-related factors, binary or multinomial multi-factor logistic regression was employed to adjust for confounding variables and to calculate the exposure factor contributions." (Page 4)</div>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Rationale for Excluding the &quot;Slightly Symptomatic&quot; Category</strong>
        <p>While the researchers mention that the &quot;slightly symptomatic&quot; category was excluded to mitigate bias, they could provide a more detailed explanation for this decision. This would enhance transparency and allow readers to better understand the potential impact of this exclusion on the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, the “slightly symptomatic” option was excluded from the final symptom statistic, as it is more prone to be influenced by psychological factors, recall bias, and post pandemic stress." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clearer explanation of the rationale for excluding the &quot;slightly symptomatic&quot; category would enhance the study&#39;s transparency and allow readers to assess the potential impact of this decision on the prevalence estimates. It would also address potential concerns about the underestimation of long COVID symptoms.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the sentence explaining the exclusion of the &quot;slightly symptomatic&quot; category to provide a more detailed rationale. This could include discussing the specific types of bias that this category is prone to (e.g., recall bias, social desirability bias) and how excluding it helps to mitigate these biases. Additionally, the researchers could consider reporting the prevalence of long COVID symptoms both with and without the &quot;slightly symptomatic&quot; category to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to this exclusion.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Details About the Propensity Score Matching Procedure</strong>
        <p>The researchers could provide more details about the propensity score matching procedure, including the specific matching algorithm used, the caliper width, and the assessment of covariate balance after matching. This would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For baseline adjustment, propensity score matching was performed using the MatchIt R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/)." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more details about the propensity score matching procedure would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis. It would allow readers to assess the appropriateness of the matching procedure and understand how the researchers ensured balanced baseline characteristics between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a separate paragraph or subsection describing the propensity score matching procedure in detail. This should include the specific matching algorithm used (e.g., nearest neighbor matching, optimal matching), the caliper width, and the criteria used to assess covariate balance after matching (e.g., standardized mean differences). The researchers could also consider presenting a table summarizing the covariate balance before and after matching.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address the Potential Limitations of the Referral System for Recruitment</strong>
        <p>The researchers acknowledge some limitations of the study, but they could specifically address the potential limitations of using a referral system for recruitment. This approach might introduce selection bias, as individuals with long COVID symptoms might be more likely to participate or refer others with similar experiences.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The Questionnaire on Long-Term Symptoms After SARS-CoV-2 Infection was mainly distributed in the form of a referral system, with participants calling on others to join." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging the potential limitations of the referral system for recruitment would enhance the study&#39;s transparency and help readers interpret the findings within the appropriate context. It would also highlight the need for caution in generalizing the results to the broader Chinese population.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a sentence or two in the limitations section of the discussion acknowledging the potential for selection bias introduced by the referral system. The researchers could also discuss strategies for mitigating this bias in future research, such as using a more representative sampling method.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of a large-scale online survey on long COVID in China. It describes the demographic characteristics of the 68,200 participants, the prevalence of various long COVID symptoms, and the association of these symptoms with factors like age, gender, region, acute illness severity, underlying diseases, vaccination status, and reinfection. The results show that fatigue, memory decline, and decreased exercise ability are the most common long COVID symptoms, with women being more susceptible than men. The study also finds that severe acute illness and underlying diseases increase the risk of long COVID, while vaccination, particularly booster doses, offers protection. Reinfection, although associated with milder acute symptoms, leads to a higher incidence and severity of long COVID. Additionally, the results suggest a potential link between COVID-19 and increased susceptibility to other infections like bacterial, influenza, and mycoplasma infections.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Demographic Characteristics of Participants:</strong> The majority of participants were women (57.41%) and aged between 18 and 60 years (95.26%). Most resided in eastern, northern, central, and southern China. Nearly all participants had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, with most receiving three doses. The most common underlying conditions were chronic rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis, hypertension, allergies, and gastrointestinal diseases.</li><li><strong>Prevalence of Long COVID Symptoms:</strong> The most frequent long COVID symptoms reported were fatigue (30.53%), memory decline (27.93%), decreased exercise ability (18.29%), cough/expectoration (18.83%), thirst/dry mouth (18.06%), sleep disorders (17.41%), and brain fog (16.87%). The prevalence of these symptoms was lower among those infected only once, suggesting a cumulative effect of reinfection.</li><li><strong>Risk Factors for Long COVID:</strong> The study identified several risk factors for long COVID, including prolonged acute infection duration, severe illness requiring hospitalization or ICU treatment, and various underlying diseases like chronic rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis, hypertension, allergy, gastrointestinal disease, gout, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, pulmonary diseases, diabetes, and chronic liver or kidney disease. Smoking and drinking were also associated with an increased risk of long COVID.</li><li><strong>Protective Effect of Vaccination:</strong> Vaccination significantly reduced the risk of various long COVID symptoms, with booster shots further enhancing the protective effect. Receiving three doses of inactivated vaccines or combinations of inactivated vaccines with adenovirus vector or protein subunit vaccines showed significant protection against a wide range of symptoms.</li><li><strong>Impact of Reinfection:</strong> Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with milder acute symptoms and shorter illness duration compared to the first infection. However, reinfection led to a higher incidence and severity of long COVID, with the risk increasing exponentially with the number of infections.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>

        <strong>Detailed Presentation of Findings</strong>
        <p>The Results section provides a comprehensive and detailed account of the study&#39;s findings, covering a wide range of aspects related to long COVID. The authors present the data clearly, using figures and tables to illustrate key trends and associations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The final statistical results of all COVID-19 participants revealed that the most common long-term COVID symptoms at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were fatigue (30.53%, 24.18%, 23.54%, 21.46%), memory decline (27.93%, 23.37%, 22.57%, 20.05%), decreased exercise ability (18.29%, 13.88%, 13.75%, 11.89%), cough/expectoration (18.83%, 13.45%, 13.43%, 12.02%), thirst/dry mouth (18.06%, 12.83%, 13.17%, 11.28%, 9.44%), sleep disorders (17.41%, 13.94%, 13.51%, 12.45%) and brain fog (16.87%, 13.09%, 12.71%, 10.81%) (Fig. 1f and Table S1)." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Effective Use of Visualizations</strong>
        <p>The authors effectively use figures and tables to present the data, making it easier for readers to grasp key findings and trends. The visualizations are clear, well-labeled, and informative, complementing the textual descriptions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The map of China displays the geographical distribution of the valid high quality samples collected." (Page 5)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Clear Statistical Analysis</strong>
        <p>The authors clearly describe the statistical methods used to analyze the data, including multinomial logistic regression and propensity score matching. They also report the relevant statistical measures, such as odds ratios and p-values, allowing readers to assess the strength of the associations.</p>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Context for the Severity Scores</strong>
        <p>While the authors report the severity scores for acute and long COVID symptoms, they could provide more context for these scores. Describing the specific criteria used to define each severity level would enhance the interpretability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For the long COVID questions, we adapted from the international version of the Symptom Burden Questionnaire for Long COVID (SBQ-LC)." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more context for the severity scores would help readers understand the clinical significance of the findings. It would also allow for better comparisons with other studies using different severity scales.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a table or a supplementary figure that describes the specific criteria used to define each severity level for both acute and long COVID symptoms. For example, the table could specify the types and intensity of symptoms that correspond to each severity level.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Potential Impact of Recall Bias</strong>
        <p>The study relies on participants&#39; self-reported recall of their symptoms and infection history. The authors could acknowledge the potential for recall bias, particularly for symptoms experienced months prior to the survey. Discussing strategies for minimizing recall bias, such as using objective measures or prompting participants with specific time frames, would strengthen the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The time since the first SARS-CoV-2 infection was used as reference point to calculate the approximate post-infection duration. Specifically, participants were asked to recall and chose how many months had passed since their first infection when filling out the questionnaire, with available options of &lt; 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 months (Table S12)." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging and addressing the potential for recall bias would enhance the study&#39;s rigor and transparency. It would also highlight the need for caution in interpreting the findings, particularly for symptoms experienced a long time ago.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a paragraph in the limitations section of the discussion acknowledging the potential for recall bias. The authors could also discuss strategies for minimizing recall bias in future research, such as using objective measures (e.g., medical records) or prompting participants with specific time frames to aid their recall.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Potential Explanations for the Regional Differences in Long COVID Prevalence</strong>
        <p>The study finds a higher prevalence of long COVID in northern China. The authors speculate that low temperatures might contribute to this difference, but they could explore other potential explanations, such as variations in healthcare access, socioeconomic factors, or genetic predispositions. A more in-depth discussion of these factors would enhance the understanding of the regional patterns.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Interestingly, we found that in general, multiple long COVID symptoms were generally more prevalent in the northeast, northwest and northern China, while they were less common in central and eastern China (Fig. S2e and Table S5)." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Exploring multiple potential explanations for the regional differences in long COVID prevalence would provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to these patterns. It would also highlight the need for further research to investigate the complex interplay of environmental, social, and biological factors in long COVID.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion of the regional differences to include a broader range of potential explanations. This could involve discussing factors like healthcare access, socioeconomic status, air pollution levels, genetic predispositions, and cultural practices that might influence the prevalence and severity of long COVID. The authors could also suggest specific research questions to investigate these factors in future studies.</p>

        <p>This figure uses two forest plots to show how the severity and duration of someone&#39;s initial COVID-19 infection relate to the chances of experiencing severe long COVID symptoms. Imagine each long COVID symptom as a hurdle you have to jump over. The plots show how much higher or lower those hurdles become based on how long you were sick initially or how serious your first infection was. Plot (a) looks at how long it took for someone&#39;s initial COVID symptoms to get much better (3-7 days, 8-14 days, or over 2 weeks). It compares these groups to people who felt better within 3 days. Each dot on the plot shows how much more likely someone is to have a particular long COVID symptom if they took longer to recover initially. For example, if a dot is at 2, it means they are twice as likely to have that symptom. Plot (b) looks at how serious the initial infection was based on whether someone needed to go to the hospital or even the ICU. It compares these groups to people who didn&#39;t need any hospital care. Again, each dot shows how much more likely someone is to have a specific long COVID symptom if their first infection was more serious.</p>

        <summary>Figure Fig. 3</summary>
        <p>This figure uses two forest plots to show how getting a COVID-19 vaccine affects the chances of having long COVID symptoms. Think of it like this: the vaccine is like a shield that can protect you from long COVID. The plots show how strong that shield is depending on which vaccine you got and how many doses you received. Plot (a) looks at &#39;obvious&#39; long COVID symptoms, while Plot (b) looks at &#39;severe&#39; symptoms. Each horizontal line on the plots represents a different vaccine combination (like 3 doses of an inactivated vaccine plus 1 booster). The dot on each line shows how much more or less likely someone is to have a particular long COVID symptom if they got that vaccine combination compared to someone who didn&#39;t get vaccinated at all. If the dot is to the left of the vertical line at 1, it means the vaccine is protective and reduces the risk of that symptom. If it&#39;s to the right, it means the vaccine might actually increase the risk, though this was rare in the study.</p>
