            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This study investigated the relationship between the percentage of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) achieved during interval training and improvements in cycling performance.

    <li>
        <strong>Include a brief mention of the practical implications.</strong>
        <p>While the abstract effectively summarizes the findings, adding a sentence about the practical implications for coaches and athletes could enhance its impact.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction establishes the context for studying the relationship between training intensity, measured by percentage of VO2max, and resulting adaptations in cyclists. It highlights existing research on the importance of high-intensity exercise near VO2max for stressing the oxygen system and its use as a training stimulus. While previous studies have explored time spent at or above 90% of VO2max, the introduction points out inconsistencies in findings regarding its correlation with performance improvements. This study aims to address this ambiguity by investigating the relationship between the average percentage of VO2max during power output-matched interval sessions and changes in endurance performance and physiological determinants in well-trained cyclists.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Aspect 1: High-intensity exercise near VO2max is considered crucial for stressing the body&#39;s oxygen delivery and utilization system, making it a key focus in interval training optimization.</li><li>Aspect 2: Existing research presents conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between time spent at or above 90% VO2max and actual training adaptations.</li><li>Aspect 3: This study aims to clarify the relationship between the average percentage of VO2max during interval training and improvements in endurance performance and physiological determinants.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear research gap identification</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively highlights the conflicting evidence in existing literature regarding the relationship between high-intensity training and adaptations, establishing a clear need for the present study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Consequently, scientific evidence supporting the importance of exercising at a high % of V̇O2max for superior training adaptations are ambiguous." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-defined research question</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly states the objective of the study, which is to explore the relationship between the average % of VO2max during power output-matched interval sessions and changes in endurance performance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Hence, the objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between the average % of V̇O2max during PO-matched interval sessions and changes in endurance performance and its physiological determinants among well-trained cyclists." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Justification for the study</strong>
        <p>The introduction provides a rationale for the study by emphasizing the need for research that directly investigates the impact of % of VO2max on training adaptations, given the current training advice based on this assumption.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Considering that current training advice are made based on the assumption that sustaining a high % of V̇O2max during exercise translates into greater training adaptations (Buchheit et al., 2013; Midgley et al., 2006a, 2006b; Wenger et al., 1986), studies investigating whether it actually does are warranted." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the chosen methodology</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions power output-matched intervals, briefly explaining the rationale behind this approach would strengthen the methodological foundation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Hence, the objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between the average % of V̇O2max during PO-matched interval sessions and changes in endurance performance and its physiological determinants among well-trained cyclists." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide readers with a better understanding of the study&#39;s design and its potential implications.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief sentence explaining why power output-matched intervals were chosen as the training protocol.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide a concise overview of the participant characteristics</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions &quot;well-trained cyclists,&quot; briefly outlining key characteristics like training experience or performance level would enhance the context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Hence, the objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between the average % of V̇O2max during PO-matched interval sessions and changes in endurance performance and its physiological determinants among well-trained cyclists." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would help readers understand the specific population being studied and the generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a concise description of the participants&#39; training background and performance level in a brief sentence.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the &quot;other metrics&quot; being considered</strong>
        <p>The introduction mentions that the study will assess if % of VO2max outperforms &quot;other metrics&quot; in predicting adaptations, but doesn&#39;t specify these metrics.</p>
        <div class="quote">"and that these measures would outperform other metrics in accurately reflecting training adaptations." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Identifying these metrics would provide a clearer picture of the study&#39;s scope and comparisons.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> List the specific &quot;other metrics&quot; that will be used for comparison, such as heart rate or power output.</p>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the rationale for the specific interval protocols</strong>
        <p>While the section describes the different interval protocols, it could benefit from explaining the physiological reasoning behind the chosen variations in work interval durations and intensities.</p>
        <div class="quote">"alternating between 30-s at 118% of PO40min and 15-s at 60% of PO40min, 2) alternating between 60-s at 110% and 90% of PO40min, and 3) constant at 100% of PO40min." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing the rationale would enhance the understanding of the training intervention&#39;s design and its potential impact on the study outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a brief explanation of the physiological basis for each interval protocol, perhaps referencing relevant exercise physiology principles or previous research.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detail on the participant&#39;s off-season training</strong>
        <p>The section briefly mentions the participants&#39; usual off-season training but lacks specifics. More details on the type, intensity, and volume of training would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"At the onset of the 9-week training intervention, the participants had undertaken their usual off-season training (08:49 (02:55) h:m·week−1 during the 4 weeks preceding pre-testing)." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This information would help contextualize the participants&#39; training background and potentially influence the interpretation of the study&#39;s findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include details about the type, intensity, and volume of off-season training undertaken by the participants.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explain the rationale for the secondary analyses</strong>
        <p>The section mentions secondary analyses based on high and low VO2max groups but doesn&#39;t fully explain the purpose or expected insights from this approach.</p>
        <div class="quote">"secondary analyses were performed by dividing participants into two groups based on whether their average % of V̇O2max during the interval sessions was in the highest or lowest half of the group" (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Clarifying the rationale would strengthen the justification for the secondary analyses and their contribution to the overall research question.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explain the specific research question or hypothesis being addressed by the secondary analyses and how the high/low VO2max grouping helps investigate this.</p>

            <p>This section presents the findings of the study, highlighting the positive relationship between the percentage of V̇O2max achieved during interval training and changes in performance indicators like Wmax, PO4mmol, and the performance index. It also compares the training adaptations between participants with the highest and lowest % of V̇O2max during intervals, showing greater improvements in the high %V̇O2max group. Finally, it explores the relationship between baseline measures and %V̇O2max during intervals and examines other adaptive potential measures and their reproducibility.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Aspect 1: A positive correlation was found between the average % of V̇O2max during interval sessions and improvements in Wmax, PO4mmol, performance index, and V̇O2max.</li><li>Aspect 2: Participants achieving the highest % of V̇O2max during intervals (HIGH%V̇O2max) demonstrated significantly greater improvements in Wmax, PO4mmol, performance index, and V̇O2max compared to the lowest % of V̇O2max group (LOW%V̇O2max).</li><li>Aspect 3: Baseline PO4mmol, PO15min, and % of V̇O2max@4mmol were positively related to the % of V̇O2max achieved during interval sessions. Other adaptive potential measures like time ≥90% of V̇O2max and % of HRmax showed weaker associations with training adaptations and lower reliability.</li>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section interprets the study&#39;s findings, emphasizing the positive relationship between %V̇O2max during interval training and improvements in endurance performance measures (Wmax, PO4mmol, performance index). It supports the hypothesis that higher %V̇O2max elicits greater training adaptations, discussing this in the context of existing literature. The discussion also analyzes the effects of %V̇O2max on physiological determinants of endurance performance (V̇O2max, fractional utilization of V̇O2max, gross efficiency), and compares the effectiveness of %V̇O2max with other training variables like %HRmax. Finally, it acknowledges limitations and suggests %V̇O2max as a robust measure for optimizing interval training.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Aspect 1: Higher %V̇O2max during interval training is positively associated with greater improvements in Wmax, PO4mmol, and performance index, suggesting its importance for optimizing training adaptations.</li><li>Aspect 2: %V̇O2max is a more robust and reliable indicator of training adaptations compared to other measures like %HRmax and time ≥90% of HRmax, which showed weaker associations and lower reproducibility.</li><li>Aspect 3: While %V̇O2max was positively related to improvements in V̇O2max, its relationship with fractional utilization of V̇O2max and gross efficiency was less clear, suggesting these factors might be influenced by other training variables or require longer training durations.</li>
            </ul>
