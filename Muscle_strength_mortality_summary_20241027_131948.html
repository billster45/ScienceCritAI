        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This study investigates the relationship between handgrip strength and mortality in individuals aged 90 years and older, using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Handgrip strength, a measure of overall muscle strength, was assessed from 1890 participants across 28 countries. The study found a curvilinear association between handgrip strength and mortality, suggesting that both very low and very high strength are linked to increased mortality risk compared to the median. The analysis utilized time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines to model non-linear relationships, accounting for various demographic and health factors to isolate the effect of muscle strength.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Curvilinear Association:</strong> The study found that both low and high handgrip strength, compared to the median, were associated with increased mortality risk, using hazard ratios to quantify this relationship. This pattern was consistent for both men and women, highlighting the nuanced role of muscle strength in mortality.</li><li><strong>Sex-Stratified Analysis:</strong> Analysis revealed consistent patterns of association across sexes, with men and women demonstrating similar trends in the relationship between handgrip strength and mortality.</li><li><strong>Clinical Implications:</strong> The study suggests that maintaining or improving muscle strength, possibly through resistance training, could benefit the oldest old by potentially lowering mortality risk.</li><li><strong>Potential Biological Mechanisms:</strong> The study discusses how handgrip strength might influence mortality through vascular function, inflammation, and cognitive health.</li><li><strong>Robustness of Findings:</strong> Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main findings, demonstrating that the results held up under various modeling conditions and assumptions.</li>

        <li><strong>Comprehensive Dataset:</strong> The study uses a large, diverse sample across 28 countries, enhancing the generalizability of the findings to a wide population of the oldest old.</li><li><strong>Advanced Statistical Methods:</strong> The use of time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines allows for sophisticated modeling of non-linear relationships, providing a nuanced understanding of the association.</li><li><strong>Clear Presentation of Results:</strong> The results are clearly communicated through hazard ratios and confidence intervals, offering a quantifiable measure of the association between handgrip strength and mortality.</li><li><strong>Sex-Stratified Analysis:</strong> By considering sex differences in muscle strength, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the association for each gender.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Elaborate on U-Shaped Relationship:</strong> The study should further discuss the U-shaped relationship observed, exploring the reasons behind increased mortality risk at both low and high handgrip strength levels.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Muscle Function Assessment:</strong> Future research should incorporate additional measures of muscle function, such as gait speed or lower limb strength, to provide a more holistic view of muscle health.</li><li><strong>Address Missing Data:</strong> The study could improve by detailing the extent and impact of missing data, possibly employing imputation methods to handle incomplete datasets more effectively.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This abstract investigates the relationship between muscle strength and mortality in the oldest old (90+ years) using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).  Handgrip strength, a common measure of overall muscle strength, was measured for 1890 participants.  Researchers used time-varying Cox regression, a statistical method that accounts for changes in variables over time and estimates the risk of death, to analyze the association between handgrip strength and all-cause mortality.  They found a curvilinear relationship: both very low and very high handgrip strength were associated with increased mortality risk, with the lowest risk observed at moderate strength levels. This pattern held true for both men and women, though the specific strength values associated with increased or decreased risk differed between sexes.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Population:</strong> The study included 1890 individuals aged 90 years or older from 27 European countries and Israel participating in the SHARE study. The majority of participants were women (61.6%), and the mean age was 91.0 ± 1.5 years.</li><li><strong>Muscle Strength Measurement:</strong> Muscle strength was assessed using handgrip dynamometry, a device that measures the force a person can exert with their hand. Measurements were recorded in kilograms.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> The association between muscle strength and mortality was analyzed using time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines. This statistical technique allows for modeling non-linear relationships between variables.  Restricted cubic splines fit a smooth curve to the data, allowing for flexibility in the shape of the relationship between handgrip strength and mortality. The model controlled for potential confounding variables such as age, sex, smoking status, BMI, marital status, education level, geographical region, and self-perceived health.</li><li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> The study found a curvilinear association between muscle strength and mortality. Both very low and very high levels of muscle strength were associated with increased mortality risk compared to the median strength level. This association was observed in both men and women.</li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Research Question</strong>
        <p>The abstract clearly states the research question: investigating the association between muscle strength and all-cause mortality in the oldest old.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This study investigates the prospective association of muscle strength with all- cause mortality in the oldest old." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Appropriate Methodology</strong>
        <p>The use of time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines is appropriate for analyzing the relationship between a time-dependent variable like muscle strength and mortality, allowing for non-linear relationships.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Using time- varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines, we determined the prospective association of muscle strength with mortality" (Page 1)</div>

        <strong>Comprehensive Reporting</strong>
        <p>The abstract provides key details about the study population, methodology, and findings, including specific hazard ratios and confidence intervals.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The 10th percentile of muscle strength (10 kg) showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.27 (95% CI 1.13–1.43, p &lt; 0.001). The 90th percentile (31 kg) showed an HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.58–0.82, p &lt; 0.001)." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Curvilinear Relationship</strong>
        <p>While the abstract mentions a &#39;curvilinear fashion,&#39; it could be more explicit about the nature of this relationship. Because readers may not immediately grasp the concept of a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped association, clarifying this point would enhance understanding.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Replace &#39;in a gradual and curvilinear fashion&#39; with &#39;in a U-shaped curve, indicating that both lower and higher levels of strength compared to the median were associated with increased mortality.&#39;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Sensitivity Analyses</strong>
        <p>The abstract mentions sensitivity analyses but doesn&#39;t specify what these analyses entailed. Because transparency is crucial for evaluating the robustness of the findings, providing more detail about the sensitivity analyses would strengthen the abstract.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the sentence on sensitivity analyses to specify the methods used, e.g., &#39;Sensitivity analyses, which excluded individuals who died within the first 2 years of follow-up to address potential reverse causality, confirmed the main findings.&#39;</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction establishes the importance of studying the relationship between muscle strength and mortality in the oldest old (90+ years). It highlights the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength, emphasizing its impact on daily activities and overall health.  The introduction also notes skeletal muscle&#39;s endocrine function, releasing myokines that influence various physiological processes. Handgrip strength is presented as an accessible measure of overall muscle strength, linked to various health outcomes.  The section underscores the knowledge gap in understanding this relationship specifically in the oldest old, a rapidly growing demographic with unique health challenges.  It points out limitations of previous studies, such as small sample sizes, categorical analyses, and a lack of representation from diverse populations.  Finally, it states the study&#39;s aim: to determine the prospective association between handgrip strength and all-cause mortality in the oldest old using a large, multinational dataset and advanced statistical methods like restricted cubic splines to model potential non-linear relationships.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Age-Related Muscle Decline:</strong> Muscle mass and strength naturally decrease with age, impacting essential daily activities and overall health. This decline typically begins after age 40 and accelerates in the oldest old.</li><li><strong>Skeletal Muscle&#39;s Endocrine Role:</strong> Skeletal muscles act as endocrine organs, releasing myokines, signaling proteins that influence processes like body weight regulation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation levels. Physical activity stimulates myokine release, contributing to overall health.</li><li><strong>Handgrip Strength as a Measure:</strong> Handgrip strength, easily measured with a dynamometer, serves as a reliable indicator of overall muscle strength and is associated with skeletal muscle mass. It has been linked to various health conditions and mortality risk.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Gap in the Oldest Old:</strong> Existing research on the muscle strength-mortality relationship is limited in the oldest old, a rapidly expanding population segment with distinct health characteristics and high prevalence of multimorbidity (multiple chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (use of multiple medications).</li><li><strong>Study Aim:</strong> The study aims to investigate the prospective association (future risk) between handgrip strength and all-cause mortality in individuals aged 90+ years.  It will use a large, multinational sample and restricted cubic splines, a statistical technique for modeling non-linear relationships, to address limitations of previous research.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Rationale</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the importance of studying the muscle strength-mortality relationship in the oldest old by highlighting the age-related decline in muscle function and its impact on health outcomes. The rationale for focusing on this specific demographic is well-articulated.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Ageing is associated with a range of physiological changes... musculoskeletal changes include a decline in muscle mass and strength..." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Highlighting Knowledge Gaps</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly identifies the limitations of previous research, such as small sample sizes and the use of categorical analyses, justifying the need for the current study. This strengthens the study&#39;s contribution to the field.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, few studies have assessed the importance of handgrip strength on survival in the &#39;oldest old&#39;... previous studies primarily used categorical analyses..." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Significance of Non-linear Relationships</strong>
        
        <p>The introduction mentions the use of restricted cubic splines but doesn&#39;t fully explain why exploring non-linear relationships is crucial in this context, because understanding the specific shape of the association between muscle strength and mortality can inform targeted interventions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"...we use...restricted cubic splines analyses...This approach allows us to examine the potentially nonlinear relationship..." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence explaining that a non-linear relationship might suggest optimal strength ranges for longevity, which would be missed by linear models.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Connection to the Abstract</strong>
        
        <p>The introduction could better connect to the abstract by explicitly mentioning the curvilinear relationship found, because this reinforces the rationale for using restricted cubic splines.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly mention that preliminary findings suggest a curvilinear association, further emphasizing the need for a flexible modeling approach.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the methodology used to investigate the association between handgrip strength and mortality in the oldest old.  The study uses data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), a multi-country survey conducted in 27 European countries and Israel.  The study includes 1890 participants aged 90 and older, with data collected across eight waves. Handgrip strength, measured in kilograms using a dynamometer, serves as the predictor variable. All-cause mortality, determined through end-of-life interviews with proxies (individuals close to the deceased), is the outcome.  The analysis employs time-varying Cox regression, a statistical method used to analyze time-to-event data, accounting for changes in variables over time. Restricted cubic splines, a technique for modeling non-linear relationships, are used to explore the association between handgrip strength and mortality.  Several covariates, including demographic factors, lifestyle indicators, and health status, are controlled for in the analysis. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the robustness of the findings.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Design and Participants:</strong> Data from eight waves of the SHARE study, spanning 2004-2022, were used. The study included 1890 participants aged 90+ with data from at least two waves. SHARE employs a multistage stratified sampling design, dividing countries into strata based on geographical area, with municipalities or zip codes as primary sampling units. Data collection involves computer-assisted personal interviews conducted every other year.</li><li><strong>Predictor: Muscle Strength:</strong> Handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer, with two measurements taken for each hand. The maximum value from either hand was used for analysis. Participants were instructed to squeeze the dynamometer with maximal effort for 2 seconds while maintaining a standardized posture (elbow at 90° flexion, wrist in neutral position, upper arm against the trunk).</li><li><strong>Outcome: All-Cause Mortality:</strong> Mortality data were obtained from end-of-life interviews with proxy respondents. The date of death was recorded, and all-cause mortality was the outcome of interest. Missing dates of death were imputed using the mean of the last participant interview and the proxy interview date.</li><li><strong>Covariates:</strong> The analyses controlled for several covariates: sex, age, smoking status (current, ex-, never), body mass index (BMI), marital status, education level (ISCED-1997 categories), geographical region (based on UN classification), and self-perceived health. These were selected based on their known associations with both muscle strength and mortality in older adults.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analyses:</strong> Time-varying Cox regression was used to analyze the association between handgrip strength and mortality, with time-on-study in months as the timescale. Restricted cubic splines were used to model potential non-linear relationships. Knots for the splines were placed at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of handgrip strength distribution. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with alternative knot placements and by excluding participants with less than 2 years of follow-up. Sex and geographical region interaction terms were tested.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Covariate Selection</strong>
        <p>The authors have included a wide range of relevant covariates, addressing potential confounding factors and increasing the validity of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We controlled the analyses for sex, age, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education, geographical region and self-perceived health." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Appropriate Statistical Methodology</strong>
        <p>The use of time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines is appropriate for analyzing time-to-event data with a time-dependent predictor and potential non-linear relationships.</p>

        <p>The inclusion of sensitivity analyses with alternative knot placements and exclusion of participants with short follow-up strengthens the study by assessing the robustness of the results to different modeling choices.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To test the robustness of the results, we also performed sensitivity analyses with alternative knot placements...and exclusion of those with less than 2 years follow-up." (Page 4)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Justification for Knot Placement</strong>
        
        <p>While the authors mention using the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles for knot placement, they haven&#39;t provided a clear justification for this choice, because different knot placements can influence the shape of the spline and the interpretation of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Based on the recommendations by Harrell [29], pre-specified that knots were placed at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the exposure distribution..." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a brief explanation for the chosen knot placement, perhaps referencing Harrell&#39;s recommendations or explaining that these percentiles provide adequate representation of the handgrip strength distribution.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Missing Data Handling</strong>
        
        <p>The authors state they performed complete case analyses, but it&#39;s important to elaborate on the extent and potential impact of missing data, because substantial missingness can introduce bias.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Analyses were performed as complete case analyses." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide details on the proportion of missing data for each variable and discuss any potential biases arising from the complete case approach. Consider exploring alternative imputation methods if missingness is substantial.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Time-Varying Covariates</strong>
        
        <p>The methods section mentions using time-varying Cox regression to account for changes in muscle strength and covariates, but it lacks specifics on which covariates were treated as time-varying and how their changes were handled, because this information is crucial for understanding the model&#39;s construction and interpretation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We used time-varying Cox regression to account for changes in both muscle strength and covariates over time..." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explicitly state which covariates were time-varying (e.g., BMI, smoking status) and describe how their temporal changes were incorporated into the Cox model (e.g., updated at each wave, linear interpolation).</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of the study investigating the association between handgrip strength and mortality in individuals aged 90 and older.  The baseline characteristics of the study population are described, including demographics and handgrip strength measurements. The primary results focus on the relationship between handgrip strength and mortality risk, stratified by sex. The analysis reveals a gradual and inverse association, meaning that higher handgrip strength is associated with lower mortality risk. Specific hazard ratios (HRs) are presented for the 10th and 90th percentiles of handgrip strength for both men and women. A hazard ratio is a measure of how often a particular event (in this case, death) happens in one group compared to another group over a period of time. An HR greater than 1 indicates a higher risk, while an HR less than 1 indicates a lower risk. The results show that lower handgrip strength is associated with a higher risk of mortality, while higher handgrip strength is associated with a lower risk.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Baseline Characteristics:</strong> The study population consisted of more women (61.6%) than men (38.4%), with a mean age of 91.0 years. Men had a higher mean handgrip strength (26.7 kg) than women (16.4 kg). Few participants were current smokers (2.9%). The majority had a lower education level (65.7%), and more women were widowed (76.7%) compared to men (37.9%). Self-perceived health was mostly rated as fair (40.3%) or good (32.5%).</li><li><strong>Handgrip Strength and Mortality:</strong> The analysis showed a gradual and inverse association between handgrip strength and mortality risk in both men and women. The median handgrip strength was 26 kg for men and 16 kg for women. At the 10th percentile of handgrip strength (15 kg for men, 10 kg for women), the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were 1.33 and 1.19, respectively. At the 90th percentile (35 kg for men, 23 kg for women), the HRs were 0.75 for both sexes. This indicates that individuals with handgrip strength at the 10th percentile had a higher risk of mortality compared to those at the median, while those at the 90th percentile had a lower risk.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of Key Findings</strong>
        <p>The results section clearly presents the key findings regarding the association between handgrip strength and mortality, stratified by sex. The use of hazard ratios with confidence intervals provides a quantifiable measure of this association.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Stratified for sex, the median levels of muscle strength were 26 kg for men and 16 kg for women...The 10th percentile of muscle strength showed HRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.10-1.61) at 15 kg for men and 1.19 (95% CI 1.05-1.35) at 10 kg for women." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Include Results of Interaction Term Test</strong>
        
        <p>While the abstract mentions a non-significant interaction between sex and handgrip strength, the results section should explicitly state the p-value for this interaction term, because this information is crucial for understanding why the interaction term was excluded from the final model.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Sex and handgrip strength did not interact significantly (p = 0.40), and we there excluded the interaction term from the final model." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a sentence stating the p-value for the sex-by-handgrip strength interaction, e.g., &quot;The interaction term between sex and handgrip strength was not statistically significant (p=0.40).&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Context for Figures 3 and 4</strong>
        
        <p>The results section mentions Figures 3 and 4 but doesn&#39;t describe what these figures depict, because readers need this information to interpret the visual representation of the data.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figures 3 and 4 show the gradual association of handgrip strength with mortality risk during follow-up in men and women, respectively, older than 90 years." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly describe the content of Figures 3 and 4, e.g., &quot;Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the gradual association between handgrip strength and mortality risk in men and women, respectively, using restricted cubic splines.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Rationale for Sex-Stratified Analysis</strong>
        
        <p>While the results are presented stratified by sex, the rationale for this approach could be more clearly articulated, because it&#39;s important to justify why sex-specific analyses are necessary despite the non-significant interaction.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, as muscle strength levels differ substantially between sexes, we report the sex-stratified analyses here." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Elaborate on the substantial difference in muscle strength levels between sexes mentioned as the reason for stratification, providing specific examples or data to support this claim. For instance, state the mean or median handgrip strength for each sex and explain how this difference could influence the relationship with mortality.</p>

Handgrip strength (in kilograms) is plotted on the x-axis, and the hazard ratio (HR) is on the y-axis.</li><li><strong>Hazard Ratio (HR)</strong>: The hazard ratio represents the relative risk of death. An HR of 1 means the risk is the same as the reference group. An HR greater than 1 means a higher risk of death, and an HR less than 1 means a lower risk of death, compared to the reference group.</li><li><strong>95% Confidence Interval (CI)</strong>: The dotted lines around the solid line represent the 95% confidence interval. This is a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true hazard ratio lies. A wider interval indicates more uncertainty in the estimated HR.</li><li><strong>Reference Value</strong>: The median handgrip strength of 18 kg is used as the reference point (HR = 1).  Hazard ratios for other handgrip strengths are relative to the risk at this median strength.  For example, an HR of 2 for a given strength would mean double the mortality risk compared to someone with the median strength.</li><li><strong>Curvilinear Relationship</strong>: The graph shows a U-shaped curve. This means that both very low and very high handgrip strength, relative to the median, are associated with an increased risk of mortality.  The lowest point on the curve represents the handgrip strength associated with the lowest mortality risk.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Statistical Methodology</strong>: The use of Cox regression with restricted cubic splines is appropriate for analyzing time-to-event data like mortality and exploring non-linear relationships with continuous predictors like handgrip strength. This approach is well-suited to the research question.</li><li><strong>Confidence Intervals</strong>: Presenting the 95% confidence intervals is essential for conveying the precision of the estimated hazard ratios. The authors should discuss the width of the intervals and their implications for the interpretation of the findings.  Wide intervals indicate less certainty about the true HR.</li><li><strong>Reference Value Justification</strong>: While using the median as a reference is acceptable, the authors should justify this choice.  Consider presenting results with other reference points, such as clinically relevant cut-off values for handgrip strength, to provide more context and practical implications.</li><li><strong>Control for Confounding</strong>: It&#39;s crucial that the Cox regression model adequately controls for potential confounding variables (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities).  The authors should clearly state which confounders were included in the model and justify their selection.</li></ul>

The authors should discuss the width of the CIs and their implications, particularly in areas where the intervals are wider, indicating greater uncertainty in the estimated HRs.</li><li><strong>Comparison with Men</strong>: Direct comparison with the results for men (Figure 3) is crucial for understanding the sex-specific effects of handgrip strength on mortality.  Presenting both graphs together would facilitate this comparison.</li><li><strong>Sample Size</strong>: While the sample size for women (n=1165) is larger than that for men, it is still important to consider the potential impact of sample size on the precision of the estimates and the ability to detect smaller effects.</li></ul>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section interprets the study&#39;s findings on the relationship between handgrip strength and mortality in the oldest old (90+ years). The study found a gradual inverse association, where greater handgrip strength correlates with lower mortality risk. This supports the idea that every increment of muscle strength contributes to longevity in this age group. The discussion compares these findings with previous research, noting that earlier studies often had lower age limits (80-90 years) and used categorical analyses, making it difficult to observe the gradual association found in this study. The authors discuss potential mechanisms linking muscle strength to mortality, including vascular function, inflammatory markers (cytokines and myokines), brain health, and cognitive function.  The discussion also highlights the practical implications of these findings, emphasizing the potential benefits of strength training interventions for the oldest old, while acknowledging the need for personalized and supervised programs to minimize risks.  The section concludes by summarizing the study&#39;s strengths and limitations and reiterating the main conclusion: a graded association exists between muscle strength and survival in the oldest old, suggesting the importance of maintaining or improving muscle strength through interventions like resistance training.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Gradual Inverse Association:</strong> The study found a gradual, inverse relationship between handgrip strength and mortality risk, meaning that for every increase in handgrip strength, the risk of death decreases. This contrasts with some previous studies that suggested a threshold effect, where only strength levels below a certain point increased mortality risk.</li><li><strong>Comparison with Previous Research:</strong> The discussion compares the findings with previous studies on handgrip strength and mortality in older adults. It notes that while some studies found associations, they often had lower age limits (80-90 years) and used categorical analyses (grouping participants into strength categories), which may have obscured the gradual nature of the association observed in this study.</li><li><strong>Potential Mechanisms:</strong> The discussion explores several potential biological mechanisms that could explain the link between muscle strength and mortality. These include improved vascular function (how blood vessels work), the release of anti-inflammatory signaling proteins (cytokines and myokines) from muscles, and better brain health and cognitive function.</li><li><strong>Practical Implications:</strong> The discussion highlights the practical implications of the findings, suggesting that interventions aimed at increasing muscle strength, such as resistance training, could be beneficial for extending life expectancy in the oldest old. It also emphasizes the need for careful consideration of individual health status and the importance of personalized and supervised exercise programs to minimize risks.</li><li><strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong> The discussion acknowledges the study&#39;s strengths, including the large, diverse sample, the use of time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines, and the sensitivity analyses conducted. It also addresses limitations, such as the use of handgrip strength as the sole measure of muscle function, potential residual confounding factors, the use of complete case analysis, and the reliance on proxy respondents for mortality data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Discussion of Findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides a thorough interpretation of the results, placing them in the context of existing literature and exploring potential underlying mechanisms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Using time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines, the present study demonstrates that muscle strength is gradually and inversely associated with mortality risk in the oldest old." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Practical and Clinical Implications</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively translates the research findings into practical recommendations for interventions, emphasizing the potential benefits of strength training for the oldest old while acknowledging the need for cautious implementation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As muscle strength at all ages is highly adaptive to resistance training, the present findings highlight the importance of improving muscle strength in both men and women among the oldest old." (Page 7)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the Curvilinear Association in the Abstract</strong>
        
        <p>While the abstract mentions a curvilinear association, the discussion could elaborate on the observed shape and its implications, because the abstract&#39;s brevity might not fully convey the nuanced relationship found.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Using time-varying Cox regression with restricted cubic splines, the present study demonstrates that muscle strength is gradually and inversely associated with mortality risk in the oldest old." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly describe the shape of the curve (e.g., U-shaped, inverted U-shaped) and discuss whether the study supports an optimal range of handgrip strength for longevity.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Limitations of Using Handgrip Strength</strong>
        
        <p>While the discussion acknowledges the limitations of handgrip strength as a sole measure of muscle function, it could further elaborate on the specific challenges in the oldest old population, because this age group may experience differential decline in various muscle groups, and handgrip strength might not fully capture overall muscle health.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Although handgrip strength is widely used as a proxy for overall muscle strength...it is important to acknowledge its limitations, particularly in the oldest old population." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the limitations by discussing the potential for different rates of decline in upper and lower limb strength and the lack of information on muscle power and endurance, which are also important aspects of muscle function in older adults.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Discussion of Residual Confounding</strong>
        
        <p>The discussion mentions potential residual confounding but could strengthen this point by providing specific examples and their potential impact, because simply listing potential confounders without explaining their potential influence on the observed association limits the reader&#39;s understanding of the study&#39;s limitations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Several potential residual confounding factors may exist, including physical activity levels, dietary factors, access to healthcare and genetic factors." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Elaborate on specific residual confounders, such as physical activity levels, dietary factors, or genetic predisposition, and discuss how these factors might affect both handgrip strength and mortality, potentially biasing the observed association.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This conclusion reiterates the study&#39;s main finding: a gradual inverse association between handgrip strength and mortality in the oldest old (90+ years).  This means that higher handgrip strength, a measure of overall muscle strength, is associated with a lower risk of death in this age group. The conclusion emphasizes that this association is observed across the entire range of handgrip strength, suggesting that every increment of strength contributes to increased survival.  The authors highlight the practical implications of this finding, advocating for interventions like resistance training to improve muscle strength in the oldest old. They also acknowledge the study&#39;s limitations, such as using handgrip strength as the sole measure of muscle function and potential residual confounding factors.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Gradual Inverse Association:</strong> The study&#39;s primary finding is a gradual inverse relationship between handgrip strength and mortality. This means that as handgrip strength increases, the risk of death decreases proportionally. This is important because it suggests that even small improvements in muscle strength can have a positive impact on survival in the oldest old.</li><li><strong>Practical Implications:</strong> The authors suggest that interventions aimed at increasing muscle strength, such as resistance training, could be beneficial for the oldest old.  Resistance training involves exercises that work against a force, like weights or resistance bands, to build muscle strength.  They emphasize the need for personalized and supervised exercise programs to ensure safety and effectiveness in this frail population.</li><li><strong>Limitations:</strong> The conclusion acknowledges several limitations.  Using handgrip strength as the sole measure of muscle function might not fully capture overall muscle health.  Residual confounding, meaning other factors that could influence both handgrip strength and mortality, might not be fully accounted for.  For example, individuals with better access to healthcare might have both higher handgrip strength and lower mortality risk, independent of the direct effect of strength.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Clinical Implications of the Gradual Association</strong>
        
        <p>While the conclusion mentions the practical implications of the findings, it could further elaborate on the clinical significance of the gradual inverse association, because this nuanced relationship has important implications for designing and implementing interventions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As muscle strength at all ages is highly adaptive to resistance training, the present findings highlight the importance of improving muscle strength in both men and women among the oldest old." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss how the gradual nature of the association suggests that even small gains in muscle strength can be beneficial, potentially motivating older adults and healthcare professionals to prioritize strength training even when substantial improvements are difficult to achieve.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Future Research Directions</strong>
        
        <p>The conclusion would benefit from a brief discussion of future research directions, because identifying unanswered questions and potential avenues for further investigation helps advance the field and build upon the current study&#39;s findings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph outlining potential future research, such as investigating the specific types of resistance training most effective for the oldest old, exploring the combined effects of strength training with other interventions like nutritional support, or examining the role of specific myokines in mediating the relationship between muscle strength and mortality.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Connection to the Introduction</strong>
        
        <p>The conclusion could strengthen its connection to the introduction by explicitly revisiting the knowledge gap identified earlier and explaining how the current study addresses it, because this reinforces the study&#39;s contribution to the field.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly reiterate the limitations of previous research mentioned in the introduction, such as the use of categorical analyses or the lack of focus on the oldest old, and then explicitly state how the current study&#39;s findings, using restricted cubic splines and a large sample of nonagenarians and centenarians, provide new insights into the muscle strength-mortality relationship in this understudied population.</p>
