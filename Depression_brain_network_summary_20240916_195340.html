        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This study investigated the topology of the frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression using precision functional mapping and longitudinal fMRI data. The researchers found that the salience network is significantly expanded in the cortex of most individuals with depression, a finding replicated across multiple independent samples and datasets. This expansion appears to be a stable, trait-like feature, detectable even before depression onset in children, and may be related to specific patterns of encroachment on neighboring brain networks.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The frontostriatal salience network occupies a significantly larger portion of the cortex in individuals with depression compared to healthy controls (73% larger on average).</li><li>This expansion is primarily driven by border shifts, with three distinct encroachment profiles observed, affecting the default mode, frontoparietal, and cingulo-opercular networks.</li><li>Salience network expansion is stable over time, unaffected by mood state or treatment, and is detectable in children before the onset of depression symptoms.</li><li>In one deeply sampled individual, fluctuations in functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate cortex within the salience network tracked changes in anhedonia symptoms and predicted future anhedonia.</li><li>The salience network expansion was also observed in a small sample of individuals with late-onset depression, suggesting it may be a general feature of the disorder.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study utilized a robust methodology, including precision functional mapping, multi-echo fMRI, and advanced denoising techniques, to delineate individual-specific network topology.</li><li>The findings were replicated across multiple independent samples and datasets, including both individual-level and group-average data, strengthening the reliability and generalizability of the results.</li><li>The longitudinal design allowed for the investigation of the stability of salience network expansion over time and its relationship to symptom fluctuations, providing valuable insights into its trait-like nature.</li><li>The study explored potential underlying mechanisms of salience network expansion, proposing hypotheses related to activity-dependent plasticity and genetic influences on cortical development.</li><li>The findings have potential clinical implications for early identification of individuals at risk for depression and for developing personalized treatment strategies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Further research is needed to establish causal relationships between salience network expansion and depression and to determine whether the expansion contributes to the development of the disorder or is a consequence of it.</li><li>The specificity of salience network expansion to depression needs further investigation by examining its presence in other psychiatric conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as anxiety disorders or trauma-related disorders.</li><li>A more in-depth exploration of the functional consequences of salience network expansion and its impact on specific cognitive processes and behavioral patterns relevant to depression would strengthen the link between structural and functional alterations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significant Elements</h3>

        <h4>Figure 2</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Demonstrates the heterogeneity of salience network expansion by identifying three distinct encroachment profiles affecting neighboring functional systems, highlighting individual variability in how the network is altered in depression.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Expands upon the primary finding by revealing distinct patterns of network reorganization.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study provides compelling evidence for a robust and reproducible expansion of the frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression. The findings suggest that this expansion may be a stable, trait-like marker for depression risk, potentially detectable before symptom onset. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationships, functional consequences, and specificity of this finding, but it holds promise for advancing our understanding of depression and developing new strategies for early detection and personalized interventions.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This abstract presents a study that used precision functional mapping to investigate brain network topology in individuals with depression. The study found that the frontostriatal salience network is significantly expanded in the cortex of most individuals with depression, a finding that was replicated across multiple samples. This expansion appears to be a stable, trait-like feature present even before the onset of depression in children.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction section establishes the context for a study investigating the topology of functional brain networks in individuals with depression, particularly focusing on the salience network. It highlights the limitations of previous neuroimaging studies in depression, which have primarily relied on cross-sectional designs and group-average parcellations, resulting in modest effect sizes and limited understanding of mood-state transitions. The section introduces the concept of precision functional mapping as a novel approach to delineate individual-specific network topology and its potential to reveal more meaningful differences in brain organization related to depression.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Heterogeneity and Episodic Nature of Depression:</strong> The introduction emphasizes that depression is a heterogeneous and episodic disorder, posing challenges for understanding its neurobiological basis and the mechanisms underlying mood fluctuations.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Neuroimaging:</strong> The authors critique previous fMRI studies for their reliance on cross-sectional designs and group-average parcellations, which have yielded modest effect sizes and limited insights into individual variability.</li><li><strong>Precision Functional Mapping:</strong> The introduction presents precision functional mapping as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by delineating functional networks in individuals, potentially revealing more behaviorally meaningful differences in network topology.</li><li><strong>Need for Longitudinal Studies:</strong> The authors argue that understanding mood-state transitions requires longitudinal studies with dense sampling to capture dynamic changes in brain connectivity and relate them to symptom fluctuations.</li><li><strong>Potential of Precision Mapping in Depression:</strong> The introduction suggests that precision functional mapping, combined with longitudinal data, can provide new insights into the neurobiology of depression, identify potential therapeutic targets, and aid in risk prediction.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Problem Statement</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the need for the study by clearly articulating the limitations of previous research in understanding the neurobiology of depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Compelling Rationale for Precision Mapping</strong>
        <p>The introduction provides a strong rationale for using precision functional mapping by highlighting its potential to reveal individual-specific network topology and overcome the limitations of group-average approaches.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Precision mapping studies have shown that the topology (size, shape and spatial location) of functional areas and networks in individuals deviates markedly from group-average descriptions3,15,16 and that individual differences in network topology are stable2,3,17,18, heritable19,20 and associated with cognitive abilities and behaviour3–5,13,21–23." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Longitudinal Data</strong>
        <p>The introduction convincingly argues for the importance of longitudinal data in capturing the dynamic nature of depression and understanding mood-state transitions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Depression is a fundamentally episodic neuropsychiatric condition defined by discrete periods of low mood interposed between periods of euthymia but our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate mood transitions over time is limited." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Salience Network</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions the salience network, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of its functions and relevance to depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We used state-of-the-art precision functional mapping tools to delineate topology of functional brain networks in individuals with depression, leveraging several resting-state fMRI datasets of deeply sampled individuals. We found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded by nearly twofold in most individuals with depression—an effect we replicated thrice using independent samples of repeatedly sampled individuals with depression (total n = 135) and in large-scale group-average data (n = 299 individuals with depression, n = 932 healthy controls), with three distinct types of encroachment displacing neighbouring functional systems occurring across individuals." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing a more comprehensive overview of the salience network would enhance the reader&#39;s understanding of its potential role in depression and why its topology is a focus of the study.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph briefly describing the key functions of the salience network, its involvement in reward processing, interoception, and cognitive control, and its potential implications for depression based on previous research.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specificity of Hypotheses</strong>
        <p>The introduction could be strengthened by stating more specific hypotheses regarding the expected differences in salience network topology in individuals with depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Thus, whether functional network topology differs in individuals with depression is unknown." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Formulating specific, testable hypotheses would provide a clearer direction for the study and enhance the interpretation of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Based on the rationale provided, propose specific hypotheses about the expected size, shape, or spatial location of the salience network in individuals with depression compared to healthy controls. For example, hypothesize that the salience network will be larger or that its boundaries will encroach on specific neighboring networks in individuals with depression.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Ethical Implications</strong>
        <p>While not explicitly mentioned, the introduction could briefly acknowledge the potential ethical implications of identifying brain-based markers for depression risk.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing ethical considerations, such as potential stigma or misuse of such markers, is crucial for responsible scientific conduct.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence acknowledging the importance of considering the ethical implications of identifying brain-based markers for depression risk and the need for responsible use and interpretation of such findings.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This Results section presents the findings of a study investigating the topology of the frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression. The key finding is a significant expansion of this network in the cortex of depressed individuals, a phenomenon replicated across multiple samples and datasets. The section further explores the nature of this expansion, identifying three distinct modes of encroachment on neighboring networks, and investigates its stability over time, relationship to symptom severity, and presence before symptom onset in children. Finally, the section examines the dynamic changes in functional connectivity within the salience network, particularly between the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex, and their relationship to fluctuations in anhedonia symptoms.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Salience Network Expansion:</strong> The salience network is significantly larger in the cortex of individuals with depression compared to healthy controls, occupying 73% more cortical surface area on average.</li><li><strong>Replication:</strong> This finding is consistently replicated in three independent samples of individuals with depression and in large-scale group-average data.</li><li><strong>Encroachment Modes:</strong> Salience network expansion is primarily driven by border shifts, with three distinct encroachment profiles observed, affecting the default mode, frontoparietal, and cingulo-opercular networks.</li><li><strong>Trait-like Feature:</strong> Salience network expansion is stable over time, unaffected by mood state or treatment, and is detectable in children before the onset of depression symptoms.</li><li><strong>Connectivity and Anhedonia:</strong> Longitudinal analyses reveal that fluctuations in functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate cortex within the salience network track changes in anhedonia symptoms and predict future anhedonia in one individual.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Robust Evidence</strong>
        <p>The section presents compelling evidence for the salience network expansion in depression, with multiple replications across different samples and datasets, including both individual-level and group-average data. This strengthens the reliability and generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This effect was replicated thrice (Fig. 1c, right), again with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.77–0.84), remained statistically significant when controlling for the sex ratio imbalance in our samples (56.7% of individuals with depression were female, versus 31% of the healthy controls; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2) and with or without correction for potential site- or scanner-induced biases (Supplementary Fig. 5)." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Characterization</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply reporting the expansion and provides a detailed characterization of its nature, including the identification of three distinct encroachment modes and their relationship to specific neighboring networks. This adds depth to the understanding of how the salience network is altered in depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This analysis confirmed that salience network expansion was not randomly distributed—instead, it was due primarily to border shifts affecting three neighbouring higher-order functional systems, with three distinct encroachment profiles occurring in different individuals." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Longitudinal Insights</strong>
        <p>The use of longitudinal data allows the authors to investigate the stability of the salience network expansion over time and its relationship to symptom fluctuations. This provides valuable insights into the trait-like nature of the expansion and its potential as a risk marker for depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, and consistent with previous work describing functional network topography in healthy adults as very stable features affected very little by cognitive state or daily variation17,20, we found that salience network topology was stable over time in individuals with and without depression (Fig. 3a)."

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Functional Significance</strong>
        <p>While the section thoroughly describes the topological changes in the salience network, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the functional significance of these alterations. How might the expansion and encroachment on other networks affect the salience network&#39;s role in reward processing, interoception, and cognitive control in individuals with depression?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Exploring the functional implications of the findings would bridge the gap between structural changes and their potential behavioral and clinical manifestations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the potential functional consequences of salience network expansion, drawing on existing literature on the salience network&#39;s functions and its relevance to depression. Consider how the encroachment on specific neighboring networks might contribute to specific symptom domains or cognitive deficits observed in depression.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specificity to Depression</strong>
        <p>The section mentions a preliminary analysis suggesting that the salience network is also expanded in individuals with bipolar II disorder. This raises the question of the specificity of this finding to depression. Further investigation into other psychiatric conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as anxiety disorders or trauma-related disorders, is warranted.</p>
        <div class="quote">"A preliminary analysis indicated that the salience network is also larger than normal in two individuals with bipolar II disorder but not autism spectrum disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder (Supplementary Fig. 11), which might reflect common deficits in behavioural domains, such as reward processing94, that are also linked to salience network function." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Determining the specificity of salience network expansion to depression or its presence in other disorders would clarify its potential as a diagnostic or transdiagnostic marker.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the preliminary analysis to include a larger sample of individuals with bipolar disorder and other relevant psychiatric conditions. Compare the patterns of salience network expansion across disorders to identify potential similarities or differences. Discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the shared and distinct neurobiological mechanisms underlying different psychiatric conditions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Causal Relationships</strong>
        <p>The section primarily focuses on correlational relationships between salience network topology and symptoms. While the longitudinal data provide some insights into temporal associations, further research is needed to establish causal relationships. Does salience network expansion contribute to the development of depression, or is it a consequence of the disorder?</p>
        <div class="quote">"These observations led us to propose that instead of driving changes in depressive symptoms over time, salience network expansion may be a stable marker of risk for developing depression." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the causal direction of the relationship between salience network expansion and depression is crucial for developing targeted interventions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider longitudinal studies with larger samples and longer follow-up periods to assess whether salience network expansion precedes the onset of depression. Explore potential genetic or environmental factors that might contribute to both salience network expansion and depression risk. Investigate the effects of interventions, such as psychotherapy or neuromodulation, on both salience network topology and symptom severity to assess whether changes in network structure are associated with clinical improvement.</p>

        <p>Extended Data Figure 3 explores the relationship between salience network expansion and the size of neighboring functional systems. It presents brain images depicting the salience network, default mode network, frontoparietal network, and cingulo-opercular network in both a group-average map of healthy controls and three representative individuals with depression. The figure also includes scatter plots comparing the size of these networks between healthy controls and individuals with depression. Notably, the figure suggests that while salience network expansion is consistently observed, the contraction of other networks, particularly the cingulo-opercular network, is less consistent across samples.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This Discussion section interprets the study&#39;s findings on salience network expansion in depression, highlighting its potential as a trait-like marker for depression risk and discussing possible underlying mechanisms. It also addresses the implications of the findings for understanding the interplay between trait and state effects in depression, the potential clinical utility of salience network expansion as a biomarker, and the need for further research to explore causal relationships and specificity to depression. The section concludes by emphasizing the value of precision functional mapping and longitudinal sampling in advancing our understanding of depression and developing personalized treatments.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Interpretation of Salience Network Expansion:</strong> The authors discuss the significance of the robust and reproducible finding of salience network expansion in depression, emphasizing its large effect size compared to previous neuroimaging findings.</li><li><strong>Potential Mechanisms:</strong> Two main hypotheses are proposed to explain salience network expansion: 1) activity-dependent mechanisms related to increased network usage and 2) intrinsic genetic programs influencing cortical development and network boundaries.</li><li><strong>Trait vs. State Effects:</strong> The discussion highlights the stability of salience network expansion over time and its presence before symptom onset, suggesting it may be a trait-like marker of depression risk rather than a state-dependent marker fluctuating with mood.</li><li><strong>Clinical Implications:</strong> The potential clinical utility of salience network expansion as a biomarker for predicting depression susceptibility and guiding therapeutic interventions is discussed.</li><li><strong>Future Research Directions:</strong> The need for further research to elucidate the causal relationship between salience network expansion and depression, investigate its specificity to depression compared to other psychiatric conditions, and explore the functional consequences of different encroachment modes is emphasized.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Interpretation</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides a thorough and insightful interpretation of the study&#39;s findings, considering multiple perspectives and addressing key questions raised by the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this work, precision functional mapping in deeply sampled individuals with depression showed a marked expansion of the salience network that was robust and reproducible in several samples, with medium to large effect sizes relative to previously reported neuroimaging abnormalities in depression." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Mechanistic Insights</strong>
        <p>The discussion goes beyond simply describing the findings and delves into potential underlying mechanisms, proposing two plausible hypotheses supported by evidence from the current study and previous research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Although more work will be required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying salience network expansion in depression, key results from this report and other studies point to at least two hypotheses." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clinical Relevance</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively highlights the potential clinical implications of the findings, particularly for early identification of individuals at risk for depression and for developing personalized treatment strategies.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our findings may also open new avenues to addressing two fundamental challenges to using insights from clinical neuroimaging research to rethink our approach to diagnosing and treating depression." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Functional Consequences</strong>
        <p>While the discussion touches upon the potential functional significance of salience network expansion, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of how the altered network topology might affect specific cognitive processes and behavioral patterns relevant to depression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Together, these reports suggest that salience network expansion—accompanied by a corresponding contraction of the frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular or default mode networks—may reflect a reallocation of cortical territory and information processing priorities in individuals with depression, which could in turn contribute to alterations in salience network functions such as interoceptive awareness, reward learning, autonomic signal processing and effort valuation30,40,41." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of the functional consequences would strengthen the link between the observed structural changes and their potential behavioral and clinical manifestations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion on functional significance by elaborating on how salience network expansion might affect specific cognitive functions, such as attention to internal states (interoception), reward sensitivity, emotional regulation, and cognitive control. Consider how these alterations might contribute to the core symptoms of depression, such as anhedonia, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specificity and Transdiagnosticity</strong>
        <p>The discussion acknowledges the need for further research to assess the specificity of salience network expansion to depression. This could be strengthened by explicitly considering the possibility of this finding being a transdiagnostic marker, relevant to other psychiatric conditions characterized by similar disruptions in reward processing, emotional regulation, or cognitive control.</p>
        <div class="quote">"A preliminary analysis indicated that the salience network is also larger than normal in two individuals with bipolar II disorder but not autism spectrum disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder (Supplementary Fig. 11), which might reflect common deficits in behavioural domains, such as reward processing94, that are also linked to salience network function." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Exploring the transdiagnostic potential of salience network expansion would broaden the scope of the findings and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of various psychiatric disorders.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion on specificity by explicitly addressing the possibility of salience network expansion being a transdiagnostic marker. Discuss the potential relevance of this finding to other disorders, such as anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and substance use disorders, which share overlapping symptoms and neural circuitry with depression. Propose specific research questions and study designs to investigate the presence and clinical significance of salience network expansion in these other conditions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions the potential clinical utility of salience network expansion as a biomarker, it does not explicitly address the ethical implications of identifying individuals at risk for depression based on brain imaging data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing the ethical considerations is crucial for ensuring responsible use and interpretation of such findings and mitigating potential harms, such as stigma, discrimination, or inappropriate interventions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the ethical implications of using salience network expansion as a biomarker for depression risk. Address potential concerns related to stigma, privacy, informed consent, and the potential for misuse of such information. Emphasize the importance of careful interpretation of brain imaging data in clinical settings and the need for clear guidelines and safeguards to protect individuals&#39; rights and well-being.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This Methods section meticulously outlines the datasets, MRI acquisition parameters, preprocessing steps, and analysis techniques employed in the study investigating salience network topology in individuals with depression. It provides a comprehensive description of the participant groups, including the SIMD dataset of deeply sampled individuals with depression and various healthy control datasets. The section details the multi-echo and single-echo fMRI acquisition protocols, anatomical preprocessing, cortical surface generation, and denoising procedures for both multi-echo and single-echo data. It further explains the surface processing, CIFTI generation, precision mapping of functional brain networks using the InfoMap algorithm, calculation of network size and spatial locations, classification analysis, evaluation of network displacement, assessment of network stability over time, and longitudinal analyses relating connectivity changes to symptom severity.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Datasets:</strong> The study utilized data from multiple sources, including the SIMD dataset of deeply sampled individuals with depression (n=6) and healthy controls (n=37), as well as replication samples from rTMS studies and a late-onset depression dataset. Healthy control data were also obtained from publicly available datasets like MyConnectome, Midnight Scan Club, and the Human Connectome Project.</li><li><strong>MRI Acquisition:</strong> Multi-echo fMRI data were acquired using a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner for the SIMD, Weill Cornell rTMS, and late-onset depression datasets, while a GE SIGNA 3T scanner was used for the Stanford University rTMS dataset. Single-echo fMRI data from the ABCD study and the Natural Scenes Dataset were also included.</li><li><strong>Preprocessing and Denoising:</strong> Multi-echo fMRI data underwent preprocessing steps including motion correction, distortion correction, and brain extraction, followed by denoising using multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA) implemented with the tedana.py workflow. Single-echo data were denoised using ICA-AROMA.</li><li><strong>Precision Functional Mapping:</strong> Functional brain networks were delineated in individuals using the InfoMap community detection algorithm applied to functional connectivity matrices derived from preprocessed fMRI data. Network assignments were manually reviewed and adjusted when necessary.</li><li><strong>Network Size and Spatial Location:</strong> The size of each functional network was calculated as the relative contribution of its vertices to the total cortical surface area or the total striatal volume. Density maps were created to visualize the percentage of individuals with network representation at each brain location.</li></ul>

        <strong>Detailed Description</strong>
        <p>The Methods section provides a highly detailed and comprehensive description of the datasets, MRI acquisition parameters, preprocessing steps, and analysis techniques. This level of detail is commendable and allows for thorough replication of the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The datasets used in this paper are described briefly below, with more demographic and clinical information provided in the Supplementary Information. No statistical tests were used to predetermine the sample sizes. Overall, the depression sample collectively consisted of 141 individuals (mean age 40.71 ± 13.82 years, 56.7% female) with a diagnosis of major depression (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview administered by a trained clinician) drawn from five sources—SIMD, mean age 29.47 ± 8.28 years, 3 female (F)/3 male (M), Weill Cornell rTMS 1 (conventional 6-week rTMS, mean age 40.89 ± 12.73 years, 27 F/21 M), Weill Cornell rTMS 2 (accelerated, 1-week rTMS, mean age 40.89 ± 12.73 years, 21 F/24 M), Stanford University rTMS (conventional 6-week rTMS, mean age 38.09 ± 12.77 years, 29 F/13 M) and Weill Cornell late-onset depression datasets (mean age 66.60 ± 5.31 years, 5 F/0 M)." (Page 11)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>State-of-the-Art Techniques</strong>
        <p>The study employs state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, including multi-echo fMRI, advanced denoising methods (ME-ICA and ICA-AROMA), and precision functional mapping using the InfoMap algorithm. This ensures high data quality and allows for robust and reliable analysis of individual-specific network topology.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Preprocessed multi-echo data were submitted to multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA103), which is designed to isolate spatially structured T2*-dependent (neurobiological; BOLD-like) and S0-dependent (non-neurobiological; not BOLD-like) signals and implemented using the tedana.py workflow104." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Rigorous Quality Control</strong>
        <p>The Methods section emphasizes the importance of quality control throughout the data acquisition and analysis pipeline. This includes manual review of component classifications in ICA, careful motion censoring, and correction for potential biases. Such rigorous quality control procedures enhance the validity and reliability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"All component classifications were manually reviewed by C.J.L. and revised when necessary following the criteria described in ref. 105. Mean grey matter time-series regression was performed to remove spatially diffuse noise. Temporal masks were generated for censoring high-motion time points using a framewise displacement threshold of 0.3 mm and a backward difference of two TRs, for an effective sampling rate comparable to historical framewise displacement measurements (approximately 2–4 s)."

    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Sample Size Justification</strong>
        <p>While the Methods section states that no statistical tests were used to predetermine sample sizes, it would be beneficial to provide a rationale for the chosen sample sizes, particularly for the SIMD dataset (n=6). Given the focus on individual-level analyses, a discussion of the statistical power and the feasibility of detecting meaningful effects with such a small sample size would be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The datasets used in this paper are described briefly below, with more demographic and clinical information provided in the Supplementary Information. No statistical tests were used to predetermine the sample sizes." (Page 11)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing sample size considerations would enhance the transparency and rigor of the study, allowing readers to better assess the generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the rationale for the chosen sample sizes, particularly for the SIMD dataset. Consider factors such as the expected effect size, the variability within the population, and the feasibility of recruiting and scanning deeply sampled individuals. If possible, provide power calculations or simulations to support the chosen sample sizes.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Choice of InfoMap Parameters</strong>
        <p>The Methods section mentions that free parameters for the InfoMap algorithm were fixed across subjects but does not specify the chosen parameter values. Providing a rationale for the selected parameters and exploring the potential impact of parameter choices on the resulting network parcellations would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Free parameters (for example, the number of algorithm repetitions) for the Infomap algorithm were fixed across subjects." (Page 12)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Transparency regarding parameter choices and their potential influence on the results is essential for reproducibility and for understanding the robustness of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Specify the chosen parameter values for the InfoMap algorithm and provide a justification for these choices. Consider conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of varying parameter values on the resulting network parcellations. Discuss the implications of these findings for the interpretation of the main results.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consideration of Head Motion</strong>
        <p>The Methods section describes the motion censoring procedure but does not explicitly address the potential impact of head motion on the results, particularly for the longitudinal analyses relating connectivity changes to symptom severity. Given the known influence of head motion on functional connectivity estimates, a discussion of how head motion was accounted for in these analyses and the potential limitations related to motion artifacts would be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Temporal masks were generated for censoring high-motion time points using a framewise displacement threshold of 0.3 mm and a backward difference of two TRs, for an effective sampling rate comparable to historical framewise displacement measurements (approximately 2–4 s)." (Page 12)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing head motion considerations would strengthen the robustness of the longitudinal analyses and provide a more nuanced interpretation of the relationship between connectivity changes and symptom fluctuations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> In the section describing the longitudinal analyses, add a paragraph discussing how head motion was accounted for. Consider including head motion parameters as covariates in the statistical models or using scrubbing techniques to remove motion-contaminated time points. Discuss the potential limitations of the chosen approach and the possible impact of residual motion artifacts on the results.</p>
