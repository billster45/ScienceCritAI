                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This study investigates the influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, on scientific writing by analyzing changes in vocabulary usage within a dataset of 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010 to 2024. The researchers employed a novel "excess word usage" approach, inspired by excess mortality studies, to identify words with unusually high-frequency increases after ChatGPT's release. This method allows for an unbiased assessment of LLM impact without relying on pre-existing assumptions about LLM usage patterns.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The introduction of this paper discusses the impact of major events and technological advancements on human writing, particularly in the context of scientific literature. It highlights the emergence of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, and their growing integration into academic writing tasks. The authors acknowledge both the potential benefits and concerns associated with LLM usage, including improved writing quality, potential factual errors, bias reinforcement, and plagiarism. The introduction reviews existing approaches to quantify LLM usage in scientific papers, such as LLM detectors, word frequency distribution models, and marker word lists. It identifies limitations of these approaches, particularly their reliance on ground-truth training sets and assumptions about LLM usage patterns. The authors propose a novel, data-driven approach called "excess word usage" to track LLM influence, inspired by studies of excess mortality during the Covid pandemic. This approach aims to identify words with unusually high frequency increases after the release of ChatGPT compared to pre-LLM years, without relying on pre-existing assumptions about LLM usage.</p>

                <h3>Visual Elements Analysis</h3>
                
    <div class="visual-element">
        <h4>Figure 1</h4>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Figure</p>
        <p><strong>Visual Type:</strong> Line Graph</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 1 presents nine line graphs arranged in a 3x3 grid, each depicting the frequency of a specific word in PubMed abstracts over time (2012-2024). The words are: 'delves', 'crucial', 'potential', 'these', 'significant', 'important', 'pandemic', 'ebola', and 'convolutional'. Each graph shows a blue line representing the observed frequency and a black line extending from 2021-2022, representing the counterfactual extrapolation of frequencies to 2023-2024. The first six words are identified as potentially affected by ChatGPT, while the last three are related to major events. Notably, words like 'delves', 'crucial', and 'potential' show a sharp increase in frequency in 2023-2024, deviating from the extrapolated trend. In contrast, words like 'pandemic' and 'ebola' show peaks corresponding to specific events but follow the extrapolated trend in 2023-2024.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 1 supports the introduction's argument about the impact of events and technologies on word usage. It visually demonstrates how certain words experience a sudden surge in frequency after the release of ChatGPT, suggesting a potential LLM influence. The comparison with event-related words highlights the distinct pattern observed for words potentially affected by LLMs.</p>

                <p><strong>Analysis Of Presented Data:</strong> The figure effectively presents frequency trends for multiple words over time (2012-2024). It effectively shows the sudden increase in frequency for certain words (e.g., 'delves') after 2022, coinciding with the release of ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Statistical Methods:</strong> The use of frequency counts and counterfactual extrapolation is a reasonable approach to visualize potential changes in word usage. However, the figure could benefit from the inclusion of confidence intervals or error bars to indicate the precision of these frequency estimates.</p><p><strong>Assumptions And Limitations:</strong> The analysis assumes that changes in word frequency are primarily due to the influence of LLMs. It's limited by the lack of control for other factors that might influence word usage in scientific writing. The counterfactual extrapolation assumes a linear trend, which may not always hold true.</p><p><strong>Improvements And Alternatives:</strong> 1) Include a statistical test for the significance of frequency changes pre- and post-2022. 2) Consider using a normalized frequency measure (e.g., words per million) to account for potential changes in the total volume of abstracts over time. 3) Explore alternative extrapolation methods or statistical models to account for non-linear trends.</p><p><strong>Consistency And Comparisons:</strong> The presentation is consistent across different words, facilitating easy comparison. However, it would be beneficial to include a baseline trend of overall abstract volume or total word count for reference.</p><p><strong>Sample Size And Reliability:</strong> While the figure doesn't explicitly state the sample size, it's based on a large corpus of PubMed abstracts, which likely provides reliable estimates. However, including the number of abstracts analyzed each year would strengthen the reliability assessment.</p><p><strong>Interpretation And Context:</strong> The figure effectively illustrates the dramatic increase in usage of certain words post-2022, supporting the hypothesis of LLM influence on scientific writing. However, it's important to note that correlation doesn't imply causation, and other factors could contribute to these trends.</p><p><strong>Confidence Rating:</strong> 4</p><p><strong>Confidence Explanation:</strong> This analysis is based on standard practices in corpus linguistics and trend analysis. The large dataset and clear trends provide high confidence in the observations. However, the lack of statistical significance testing and control for confounding factors prevents a perfect confidence score.</p>

They calculated the frequency of each word per year, focusing on words with a frequency above 10^-4 in both 2023 and 2024. To quantify the increase in word frequency after the release of ChatGPT, they calculated the counterfactual expected frequency in 2024 based on a linear extrapolation of word frequencies from 2021 and 2022. They defined two measures of excess usage: excess frequency gap (δ) and excess frequency ratio (r). The analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency of certain words in 2024, particularly style words like 'delves', 'showcasing', and 'underscores'. This increase was unprecedented compared to previous years, including the period of the Covid pandemic, which mainly saw an increase in content words. The researchers categorized excess words into content words and style words, finding that the 2024 excess vocabulary consisted almost entirely of style words, primarily verbs and adjectives. This finding suggests a potential influence of LLMs like ChatGPT on scientific writing.</p>

They also explain their method for annotating excess words as content or style words and their approach to analyzing subgroups based on countries, journals, fields, and inferred genders. The authors emphasize that they did not use any LLMs for writing the manuscript or performing the data analysis, ensuring the unbiased nature of their study. They also provide information on the availability of their analysis code and the original PubMed data.</p>

                <h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Methods section could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the linear extrapolation method used for calculating counterfactual word frequencies. While the authors acknowledge that this method is conservative, they could elaborate on the potential biases introduced by assuming a linear trend, especially given the rapid evolution of language models and their impact on writing styles.</li><li>The authors could provide more information on the accuracy of the gender inference method used for subgroup analysis. They acknowledge the limitations of this method, but a quantitative assessment of its accuracy would strengthen the reliability of the findings related to gender differences in LLM usage.</li>
