            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The introduction of this paper discusses the impact of major events and technological advancements on human writing, particularly in the context of scientific literature. It highlights the emergence of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, and their growing integration into academic writing tasks. The authors acknowledge both the potential benefits and concerns associated with LLM usage, including improved writing quality, potential factual errors, bias reinforcement, and plagiarism. The introduction reviews existing approaches to quantify LLM usage in scientific papers, such as LLM detectors, word frequency distribution models, and marker word lists. It identifies limitations of these approaches, particularly their reliance on ground-truth training sets and assumptions about LLM usage patterns. The authors propose a novel, data-driven approach called &quot;excess word usage&quot; to track LLM influence, inspired by studies of excess mortality during the Covid pandemic. This approach aims to identify words with unusually high frequency increases after the release of ChatGPT compared to pre-LLM years, without relying on pre-existing assumptions about LLM usage.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 1 presents nine line graphs arranged in a 3x3 grid, each depicting the frequency of a specific word in PubMed abstracts over time (2012-2024). The words are: &#x27;delves&#x27;, &#x27;crucial&#x27;, &#x27;potential&#x27;, &#x27;these&#x27;, &#x27;significant&#x27;, &#x27;important&#x27;, &#x27;pandemic&#x27;, &#x27;ebola&#x27;, and &#x27;convolutional&#x27;. Each graph shows a blue line representing the observed frequency and a black line extending from 2021-2022, representing the counterfactual extrapolation of frequencies to 2023-2024. The first six words are identified as potentially affected by ChatGPT, while the last three are related to major events. Notably, words like &#x27;delves&#x27;, &#x27;crucial&#x27;, and &#x27;potential&#x27; show a sharp increase in frequency in 2023-2024, deviating from the extrapolated trend. In contrast, words like &#x27;pandemic&#x27; and &#x27;ebola&#x27; show peaks corresponding to specific events but follow the extrapolated trend in 2023-2024.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 1 supports the introduction&#x27;s argument about the impact of events and technologies on word usage. It visually demonstrates how certain words experience a sudden surge in frequency after the release of ChatGPT, suggesting a potential LLM influence. The comparison with event-related words highlights the distinct pattern observed for words potentially affected by LLMs.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Results section details the researchers&#x27; analysis of a vast dataset of 14.4 million PubMed abstracts spanning from 2010 to 2024. They calculated the frequency of each word per year, focusing on words with a frequency above 10^-4 in both 2023 and 2024. To quantify the increase in word frequency after the release of ChatGPT, they calculated the counterfactual expected frequency in 2024 based on a linear extrapolation of word frequencies from 2021 and 2022. They defined two measures of excess usage: excess frequency gap (δ) and excess frequency ratio (r). The analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency of certain words in 2024, particularly style words like &#x27;delves&#x27;, &#x27;showcasing&#x27;, and &#x27;underscores&#x27;. This increase was unprecedented compared to previous years, including the period of the Covid pandemic, which mainly saw an increase in content words. The researchers categorized excess words into content words and style words, finding that the 2024 excess vocabulary consisted almost entirely of style words, primarily verbs and adjectives. This finding suggests a potential influence of LLMs like ChatGPT on scientific writing.</p>

            <p><strong>Visual Type:</strong> Combination Chart (Line Graph and Scatter Plot)</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 5 presents a comprehensive overview of the estimated LLM usage across various categories. Subplot (a) shows the frequency of abstracts containing at least one word from two word groups: &#x27;common words&#x27; and &#x27;rare words&#x27;. Subplots (b), (c), and (d) display scatter plots comparing the frequency gap based on &#x27;rare words&#x27; and &#x27;common words&#x27; for different fields, countries, and journals, respectively. Subplot (e) shows the frequency of abstracts containing specific words for various PubMed subsets, with the average frequency gap (Δ) indicated for each subset. The figure highlights significant variations in estimated LLM usage, with higher usage in computational fields, certain non-English speaking countries, and journals with expedited review processes.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 5 directly supports the discussion on the heterogeneity in estimated LLM usage across different categories. It provides a visual representation of the variations in frequency gaps, allowing for easy comparison across fields, countries, and journals. The figure reinforces the authors&#x27; argument that LLM usage is widespread but varies significantly depending on contextual factors.</p>
