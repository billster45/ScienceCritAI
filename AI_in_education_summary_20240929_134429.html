            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of the meta-review on AI in higher education. It covers the publication trends, types of reviews conducted, author demographics, quality assessment of the reviews, common AI applications, benefits and challenges, and identified research gaps.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Publication Trends:</strong> An increasing trend of AIEd publications, with a slight dip in 2020 likely due to the pandemic.</li><li><strong>Types of Reviews:</strong> Systematic reviews are the most common type of evidence synthesis in AIHEd.</li><li><strong>Author Demographics:</strong> AIHEd research is globally distributed, with North America, Europe, and Asia leading in contributions. Most research is domestically co-authored.</li><li><strong>Quality Assessment:</strong> The quality of AIHEd reviews is variable, with a concerning number lacking rigor in database searching, quality assessment, and reporting of methods.</li><li><strong>AI Applications:</strong> Adaptive systems and personalization, along with profiling and prediction, are the most common AI applications in higher education.</li><li><strong>Benefits and Challenges:</strong> Key benefits include personalized learning and reduced teacher workload. Ethical considerations and lack of technical knowledge are major challenges.</li><li><strong>Research Gaps:</strong> Ethical implications, methodological rigor, broader stakeholder involvement, and research in diverse contexts are identified as key research gaps.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Overview of Findings</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive overview of the findings, covering various aspects of AIEd research, from publication trends to research gaps.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Of the 66 evidence syntheses identified solely focused on AIEd in higher education (AIHEd), the majority were published as journal articles (81.8%, n = 54), as opposed to conference papers (n = 12), but only 67.6% are available open access." (Page 13)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Data-Driven Analysis</strong>
        <p>The findings are presented with supporting data and statistics, which strengthens the analysis and provides a clear picture of the AIEd research landscape.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Systematic literature reviews were by far the most popular type, accounting for two thirds of the corpus (66.7%, n = 44), followed by scoping reviews (12.1%, n = 8)." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of Key Themes</strong>
        <p>The section clearly presents the key themes emerging from the meta-review, such as the prevalence of adaptive systems and personalization, making the findings accessible and easy to understand.</p>
        <div class="quote">"More than half of the reviews (54.5%, n = 36) discussed applications related to adaptive systems and personalisation, closely followed by profiling and prediction (48.5%, n = 32)" (Page 18)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Deeper Analysis of Quality Issues</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions quality concerns, a deeper analysis of the specific methodological weaknesses and their potential impact on the findings would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The most concerning findings were that 31.8% of studies only searched in one or two databases, 51.5% did not report anything about inter-rater reliability or how screening and coding decisions were decided between review teams, only 24.2% provided their exact data extraction coding scheme, 45.5% did not undertake any form of quality assessment, and 34.8% did not reflect at all upon the limitations of their review." (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more critical perspective on the state of AIEd research and highlight areas for improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the potential biases or limitations introduced by these methodological weaknesses and how they might affect the generalizability or reliability of the findings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Further Exploration of Regional Differences</strong>
        <p>The section notes regional variations in research but could further explore the reasons behind these differences and their implications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Authorship was spread across 32 different countries (see Additional file 9: Appendix I), with arguably less dominance by the United States than two other recent EdTech tertiary reviews (Buntins et al., 2023; Zawacki-Richter, 2023) have found." (Page 15)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the global AIEd landscape and inform strategies for promoting international collaboration.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate factors like funding priorities, research infrastructure, or cultural contexts that might contribute to regional variations in AIEd research.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect Findings to Implications for Practice</strong>
        <p>While the section presents the findings, connecting them more explicitly to their implications for educators and policymakers would enhance the practical relevance of the review.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This review of reviews confirms that the benefits of AI in higher education are multifold." (Page 32)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would bridge the gap between research and practice and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss how the findings can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of AIEd initiatives in higher education institutions. Provide specific examples of how the findings can be translated into practical strategies or recommendations.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section summarizes the key findings of the meta-review on AI in higher education, highlighting the prevalence of adaptive systems and personalization, along with profiling and prediction. It emphasizes the need for increased ethics, collaboration, and rigor in future AIHEd research and practice. The discussion also addresses the global distribution of AIHEd research and the importance of open access publishing.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Predominance of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation:</strong> The review found that most AIHEd research focuses on adaptive systems and personalization, followed by profiling and prediction.</li><li><strong>Benefits of AI in Higher Education:</strong> The discussion reiterates the benefits of AI, such as personalized learning, improved learning outcomes, and reduced administrative burden for teachers.</li><li><strong>Challenges of AI in Higher Education:</strong> The discussion highlights ethical concerns, curriculum development challenges, infrastructure limitations, and the need for increased teacher technical knowledge as key obstacles to AI adoption.</li><li><strong>Global Distribution of Research:</strong> The review found a diverse range of countries contributing to AIHEd research, but with less representation from certain regions.</li><li><strong>Call for Increased Ethics, Collaboration, and Rigor:</strong> The discussion emphasizes the need for greater attention to ethical considerations, increased collaboration among researchers and stakeholders, and improved methodological rigor in AIHEd research.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Summary of Key Findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings of the meta-review, providing a concise overview of the current state of AIHEd research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"By using the framework of Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019), this tertiary review of 66 AIHEd evidence syntheses found that most reviews report findings on the use of adaptive systems and personalisation tools, followed by profiling and prediction tools." (Page 32)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Addresses Both Benefits and Challenges</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides a balanced perspective by addressing both the benefits and challenges of AI in higher education, acknowledging the complexities of AI adoption.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This review of reviews confirms that the benefits of AI in higher education are multifold. ... However, the adoption of AI in higher education is not without challenges." (Page 32)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Highlights the Importance of Open Access</strong>
        <p>The discussion emphasizes the importance of open access publishing for disseminating research findings and reducing research waste, which is crucial for advancing the field.</p>
        <div class="quote">"only 67.7% of evidence synthesis in this sample were published open access ... This limits not only the ability of educators and researchers from lower resourced institutions to read these reviews, but it decreases its visibility generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that other researchers will duplicate effort" (Page 33)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Implications for Different Disciplines</strong>
