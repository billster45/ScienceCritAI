            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This abstract outlines a research study comparing the novelty and feasibility of research ideas generated by large language models (LLMs) to those produced by expert NLP researchers. The study involved over 100 NLP researchers who generated ideas and blindly reviewed both human- and LLM-generated ideas. The key finding is that LLM-generated ideas were judged as significantly more novel than human ideas, but slightly weaker in feasibility.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>LLM Potential in Research:</strong>The study investigates the potential of LLMs to accelerate scientific discovery by autonomously generating novel research ideas.</li><li><strong>Experimental Design:</strong>A large-scale human study was conducted, involving over 100 NLP researchers, to compare LLM-generated ideas with those from human experts.</li><li><strong>Novelty Assessment:</strong>LLM-generated ideas were found to be statistically significantly more novel (p &lt; 0.05) than human expert ideas.</li><li><strong>Feasibility Trade-off:</strong>While more novel, LLM-generated ideas were judged to be slightly less feasible than human ideas.</li><li><strong>Open Problems:</strong>The study identifies open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including limitations in LLM self-evaluation and a lack of diversity in generated ideas.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Research Question</strong>
        <p>The abstract clearly states the central research question: Can LLMs generate novel, expert-level research ideas?</p>
        <div class="quote">"Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strong Methodology</strong>
        <p>The abstract highlights the rigorous methodology employed, including a large sample size of expert NLP researchers and a controlled experimental design to mitigate confounders.</p>
        <div class="quote">"By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p &lt; 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Significant Findings</strong>
        <p>The abstract presents a statistically significant finding, demonstrating the superior novelty of LLM-generated ideas compared to human ideas.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p &lt; 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Feasibility Concerns</strong>
        <p>While the abstract mentions feasibility as a weakness of LLM-generated ideas, it could benefit from a brief elaboration on the specific nature of these concerns.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p &lt; 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more context on the feasibility challenges would strengthen the abstract&#x27;s contribution by highlighting areas for future research and development.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a concise phrase or sentence outlining the common feasibility issues observed, such as lack of implementation details or unrealistic assumptions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Highlight Future Research Directions</strong>
        <p>The abstract briefly mentions open problems but could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting specific future research directions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Explicitly stating future research directions would enhance the abstract&#x27;s impact by guiding readers towards potential areas for further investigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a sentence or two outlining specific research avenues, such as developing methods to improve LLM self-evaluation or enhance the diversity of generated ideas.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction section establishes the context and motivation for evaluating the research ideation capabilities of LLMs. It highlights the potential of LLMs in scientific tasks while acknowledging the open question of their creative capabilities in research. The section emphasizes the challenges in evaluating LLM ideation and outlines the study&#x27;s approach to address these challenges through a large-scale, controlled comparison of human and LLM-generated ideas.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>LLM Capabilities in Scientific Tasks:</strong>The introduction acknowledges the growing use of LLMs in various scientific applications, such as problem-solving, proof writing, and code generation.</li><li><strong>Research Ideation as a Key Challenge:</strong>The section focuses on the specific challenge of measuring LLMs&#x27; ability to generate novel research ideas, a crucial first step in the research process.</li><li><strong>Challenges in Evaluating LLM Ideation:</strong>The introduction recognizes the difficulties in evaluating expert-level LLM capabilities, particularly in research ideation, due to factors like the subjectivity of evaluation criteria and the difficulty in judging idea quality.</li><li><strong>Study Design and Methodology:</strong>The section outlines the study&#x27;s approach to address these challenges, emphasizing a large-scale expert evaluation, controlled comparison of human and LLM ideas, and standardization of idea styles and topic distribution.</li><li><strong>LLM Agent Design:</strong>The introduction briefly introduces the LLM agent used in the study, highlighting its use of retrieval augmentation and inference-time scaling techniques.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Motivation and Focus</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the motivation for the research by highlighting the potential of LLMs in scientific discovery while focusing on the specific challenge of research ideation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"While these are useful applications that can potentially increase the productivity of researchers, it remains an open question whether LLMs can take on the more creative and challenging parts of the research process. We focus on this problem of measuring the research ideation capabilities of LLMs and ask: are current LLMs capable of generating novel ideas that are comparable to expert humans?" (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Discussion of Challenges</strong>
        <p>The introduction provides a thorough discussion of the challenges associated with evaluating LLM ideation, addressing issues like subjectivity, expert recruitment, and the difficulty in judging idea quality.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Evaluating expert-level capabilities of LLM systems is challenging (Bakhtin et al., 2022, Collins et al., 2024), and research ideation takes this to an extreme. Qualified expert researchers are difficult to recruit at scale, evaluation criteria can be highly subjective, and it is difficult for even the best experts to judge the quality of an idea (Beygelzimer et al., 2021, Simsek et al., 2024)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-Defined Methodology</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly outlines the study&#x27;s methodology, emphasizing the use of a large-scale expert evaluation, controlled comparison, and standardization techniques to mitigate potential confounders.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We address these challenges directly, recognizing that for important, high-stakes tasks like research ideation, there is no substitute for a large-scale expert evaluation. We design a carefully controlled comparison of human and LLM ideas that overcomes sample size and baseline problems present in earlier small-scale evaluation studies. Our study recruited a large pool of over 100 highly qualified NLP researchers to produce human baseline ideas and perform blind reviews of human and LLM ideas. To reduce the possibility that confounding variables affect our outcome measures, we enforce strict controls that standardize the styles of human and LLM ideas and match their topic distribution." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Evaluation Criteria</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions the use of blind reviews and standardized evaluation, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the specific criteria used to assess idea novelty and feasibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To reduce the possibility that confounding variables affect our outcome measures, we enforce strict controls that standardize the styles of human and LLM ideas and match their topic distribution." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more specific details about the evaluation criteria would enhance the transparency and rigor of the study, allowing readers to better understand how novelty and feasibility were assessed.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a sentence or two outlining the key criteria used for evaluation, such as originality, potential impact, clarity of implementation plan, and resource requirements.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Ethical Considerations</strong>
        <p>The introduction could be strengthened by briefly addressing the ethical implications of using LLMs for research ideation, particularly regarding potential biases, intellectual credit, and the impact on human researchers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging and discussing ethical considerations is crucial in AI research, demonstrating the authors&#x27; awareness of potential societal impacts and fostering responsible development and use of LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or a few sentences outlining the ethical considerations relevant to the study, such as ensuring fairness in evaluation, addressing potential biases in LLM-generated ideas, and recognizing the role of human researchers in the ideation process.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect to Broader Research Landscape</strong>
        <p>While the introduction focuses on the specific context of LLM ideation, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the broader research landscape in computational creativity and AI for scientific discovery.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Situating the study within the broader research context would enhance its significance and highlight its contribution to the field.</p>

            <h3>Problem Setup</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section outlines the experimental design for comparing human- and LLM-generated research ideas, focusing on mitigating potential confounders. It emphasizes the importance of standardizing the ideation process, idea write-ups, and the review process to ensure a fair and rigorous comparison. The section details the specific choices made for each component, including the selection of prompting-based NLP research as the testbed, the use of a structured template for idea write-ups, and the development of a style normalization module to minimize writing style biases.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Ideation Scope and Instructions:</strong>The section defines the scope of ideation, focusing on prompting-based NLP research due to its impact, executability, and suitability for follow-up experiments. It also outlines the instructions provided to both human and LLM participants, ensuring they receive the same topic description, template, and demonstration example.</li><li><strong>Idea Writeup:</strong>The section addresses potential confounders in the writing process, such as subtle cues in writing style that might signal quality. It introduces a structured template inspired by grant submissions to standardize the format and level of detail in idea proposals.</li><li><strong>Style Normalization:</strong>To further minimize writing style biases, the section describes a style normalization module that uses an LLM to convert all ideas into a consistent writing and formatting style without altering the content.</li><li><strong>Review and Evaluation:</strong>The section emphasizes the subjectivity of reviewing research ideas and outlines the design of a standardized review form. It adopts best practices from AI conference reviewing, defining clear criteria like novelty, excitement, feasibility, and expected effectiveness, along with a numerical scoring scale and free-text rationale.</li><li><strong>Experiment Conditions:</strong>The section introduces the three conditions for blind review evaluation: Human Ideas (written by experts), AI Ideas (generated by the LLM agent), and AI Ideas + Human Rerank (LLM-generated ideas manually selected by a human expert).</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Addressing Confounders</strong>
        <p>The section effectively identifies and addresses potential confounders that could bias the comparison between human and LLM-generated ideas. It recognizes the importance of controlling for factors like research area, idea format, and writing style to ensure a fair evaluation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The central experiment of our work is a comparison of human- and LLM-generated ideas. While this goal is simple, there is no existing consensus on how to formulate the task of research ideation and evaluation, and we begin by defining the key aspects of our experiment design. We think of research idea evaluation as consisting of three separate components: 1). the idea itself, generated in response to our instructions, 2). the writeup which communicates the idea, and 3). the evaluation of the writeup by experts. We outline our experiment design in each of these three parts with particular focus on potential confounders, such as the area of research, the format of a research idea, and the evaluation process." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Standardized Procedures</strong>
        <p>The section outlines clear and standardized procedures for each stage of the experiment, from idea generation to review. This meticulous approach enhances the rigor and reproducibility of the study, ensuring that the comparison between human and LLM ideas is based on a consistent and well-defined framework.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We follow best practices from AI conference reviewing (e.g., ICLR and ACL) when designing the review form, where we define four breakdown metrics including novelty, excitement, feasibility, and expected effectiveness, apart from the overall score. For each metric, we ask for a numerical score on a 1-10 scale along with a free-text rationale. We provide clear definitions and grounding for each numerical scale to calibrate all reviewers’ standards (see Appendix E for the full review form)." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Justification for Testbed Selection</strong>
        <p>The section provides a sound justification for selecting prompting-based NLP research as the testbed for the study. It highlights the relevance, impact, and executability of this research area, making it a suitable choice for both the ideation comparison and the planned follow-up experiments.</p>
        <div class="quote">"These constraints have led us to study prompting-based NLP research as a testbed for our study. Prompting research has been popular in recent years of NLP and AI research (e.g., Chen et al., 2023, Diao et al., 2024, Madaan et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2024, Schulhoff et al., 2024, Si et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023, Wei et al., 2022, Yao et al., 2023, Yasunaga et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2023, inter alia). This class of projects strikes a reasonable trade-off among our constraints. The most impactful prompting projects like chain-of-thought have had a major influence on LLM performance (Wei et al., 2022), and prompting projects are executable with minimal computing hardware." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Style Normalization</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions a style normalization module, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of its implementation and potential limitations. Specifically, it would be helpful to understand how the LLM used for style normalization is trained and whether there are any concerns about it inadvertently altering the content or introducing biases.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To reduce this possibility further, we developed a style normalization module that uses an LLM to convert all ideas into the same writing and formatting style without changing the original content. Our small-scale human study shows that such a normalization approach leads to a 50% accuracy for expert human judges who are asked to distinguish AI ideas from human ideas. Finally, the use of an LLM style anonymizer has the possibility of substantively changing the content of the ideas. To rule this out, the first author of this paper manually verified each human idea proposal to ensure all contents of the original ideas were preserved. We present the full prompt used in Appendix D." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more transparency about the style normalization process would strengthen the study&#x27;s methodological rigor and address potential concerns about the LLM&#x27;s influence on the content of the ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection detailing the training data and architecture of the LLM used for style normalization. Discuss any steps taken to mitigate potential biases or content alterations, such as manual verification or adversarial testing.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Criteria for Human Reranking</strong>
        <p>The section introduces the &quot;AI Ideas + Human Rerank&quot; condition, where a human expert manually selects the top-ranked ideas from the LLM&#x27;s output. However, it doesn&#x27;t specify the criteria used for this manual selection. Clarifying these criteria would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of this condition.</p>
        <div class="quote">"AI Ideas + Human Rerank: Idea proposals generated by our LLM agent. The first author of this paper manually selected the top-ranked ideas out of all the LLM agent’s generations rather than relying on the LLM ranker in order to better estimate the upper-bound quality of AI ideas." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the criteria used for human reranking is crucial for interpreting the results of this condition. It would allow readers to assess the potential influence of human judgment on the selection of AI-generated ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a sentence or two outlining the specific criteria used by the human expert to select the top-ranked ideas. These criteria could include factors like novelty, feasibility, potential impact, or alignment with the research topic.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Ethical Implications of Idea Generation</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on methodological rigor but doesn&#x27;t explicitly address the ethical implications of using LLMs for research idea generation. It would be beneficial to acknowledge potential concerns, such as the potential for bias in LLM-generated ideas, the impact on human creativity, and the need for responsible use of these technologies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing ethical considerations is crucial in AI research, demonstrating the authors&#x27; awareness of potential societal impacts and fostering responsible development and use of LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the ethical implications of LLM-based idea generation. Address potential biases in LLM outputs, the importance of human oversight, and the need for guidelines to ensure responsible use of these technologies in research.</p>

            <h3>Idea Generation Agent</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the construction and functionality of the LLM-based ideation agent used for generating research ideas. The agent employs a three-step process: retrieving relevant papers using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), generating a large number of seed ideas, and ranking these ideas using a pairwise comparison method trained on ICLR review data. The section emphasizes the agent&#x27;s reliance on inference-time scaling by generating a vast number of ideas and then filtering them to identify the most promising ones.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Paper Retrieval for RAG:</strong>The agent retrieves relevant papers related to the given research topic using RAG, leveraging the Semantic Scholar API and an LLM to generate and execute function calls for paper retrieval. The retrieved papers are then scored and reranked based on relevance, empirical nature, and potential for inspiring new projects.</li><li><strong>Idea Generation:</strong>The agent generates a large number (4000) of seed ideas for each research topic, using a prompt that includes demonstration examples and retrieved papers. Duplicated ideas are removed based on cosine similarity, leaving a smaller set of unique ideas.</li><li><strong>Idea Ranking:</strong>The agent ranks the remaining ideas using a pairwise comparison method trained on ICLR review data. This method involves training an LLM to predict which paper is better in pairwise comparisons of accepted and rejected ICLR submissions. The LLM ranker is used to score and rank the generated ideas, with the top-ranked ideas selected for the AI Ideas condition of the human study.</li><li><strong>Human Reranking:</strong>In addition to the LLM ranker, a human expert also manually reranks the generated ideas, forming the AI Ideas + Human Rerank condition. This aims to estimate the upper-bound quality of AI ideas and compare it to the LLM ranker&#x27;s performance.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Inference-Time Scaling</strong>
        <p>The agent leverages inference-time scaling by generating a large number of seed ideas, recognizing that only a small fraction might be high-quality. This approach aligns with recent findings on the benefits of scaling inference compute for improving LLM performance in various tasks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our key insight for idea generation is to generate as many candidate ideas as possible. Our intuition is that only a small fraction of all generated ideas might be high-quality, and we should be willing to expend inference-time compute to generate more candidates so that we can later use a reranker to discover the &quot;diamond in the rough&quot;. This aligns with existing results showing that scaling inference compute with repeated sampling can boost LLM performance on various coding and reasoning tasks (Brown et al., 2024, Li et al., 2022)." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Retrieval Augmentation</strong>
        <p>The agent incorporates retrieval augmentation by using relevant papers retrieved through RAG to inform the idea generation process. This grounding in existing literature helps to ensure that the generated ideas are contextually relevant and build upon prior work.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To ground idea generation, the agent needs to retrieve papers related to the given research topic, so that it will be aware of related works when generating new ideas. To do so, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which has demonstrated effectiveness on many knowledge-intensive tasks (Lewis et al., 2020, Shi et al., 2024)." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Pairwise Ranking Method</strong>
        <p>The agent employs a pairwise ranking method trained on ICLR review data, which has shown to be more effective than directly predicting scores or decisions. This approach leverages the LLM&#x27;s ability to make relative judgments between ideas, leading to a more reliable ranking system.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We explored multiple ways of predicting the scores and decisions of these submissions and found that LLMs are poorly calibrated when asked directly to predict the final scores or decisions, but can achieve non-trivial accuracy when asked to judge which paper is better in pairwise comparisons." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Ranking Methods</strong>
        <p>While the pairwise ranking method is effective, it relies on the availability of large-scale review data. Exploring alternative ranking methods that are less data-dependent or can leverage other forms of feedback could enhance the agent&#x27;s adaptability and generalizability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To build such an automatic idea ranker, we use public review data as a proxy." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Reducing the reliance on large-scale review data would make the agent more applicable to domains where such data is scarce or difficult to obtain.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate ranking methods based on unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or active learning, where the agent can learn from user interactions or other forms of feedback beyond explicit review scores.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Idea Duplication</strong>
        <p>The section acknowledges the issue of idea duplication, with a significant portion of generated ideas being duplicates. Further investigation into the causes of duplication and strategies for mitigating it could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the idea generation process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This leaves about 5% non-duplicated ideas out of all the generated seed ideas. We expand more on this duplication issue later in Section 7.1." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Reducing duplication would allow the agent to explore a wider range of ideas and potentially discover more novel and promising research directions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the patterns of duplication in the generated ideas to identify potential causes. Explore techniques like diversity-promoting sampling, prompt engineering to encourage novelty, or incorporating mechanisms to explicitly discourage the generation of similar ideas.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Evaluate Generalizability Across Domains</strong>
        <p>The agent is currently focused on prompting-based NLP research. Evaluating its generalizability to other research domains or tasks would provide insights into its broader applicability and potential limitations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our research ideation agent has three essential components: paper retrieval, idea generation, and idea ranking, which we will describe in detail below." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the agent&#x27;s performance across different domains would inform its potential as a general-purpose research ideation tool and highlight areas for further development.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Apply the agent to different research domains or tasks, adapting the paper retrieval and idea generation components accordingly. Evaluate the quality and novelty of the generated ideas using domain-specific experts and compare the results to those obtained in the NLP domain.</p>
    </li>

        <summary>Table Table 1</summary>
        <p>Table 1, titled &#x27;Average ICLR review scores of top- and bottom-10 papers ranked by our LLM ranker, with different rounds (N) of pairwise comparisons,&#x27; presents data in four columns: &#x27;N&#x27; (number of rounds), &#x27;Top-10&#x27; (average score of top 10 papers), &#x27;Bottom-10&#x27; (average score of bottom 10 papers), and &#x27;Gap&#x27; (difference between top and bottom scores). The table shows that as the number of rounds increases, the gap between the average scores of the top and bottom papers generally widens, indicating the effectiveness of the LLM ranker in distinguishing between high- and low-quality papers. For instance, with one round, the gap is 0.56, while with six rounds, the gap increases to 1.30.</p>

            <h3>Expert Idea Writing and Reviewing</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the human component of the research study, focusing on the recruitment, qualifications, and tasks of expert participants involved in both writing and reviewing research ideas. It outlines the recruitment process, emphasizing the high qualifications and diverse backgrounds of the participants. The section also describes the idea writing task, including the time commitment and perceived difficulty, and the idea reviewing process, highlighting the assignment procedure and quality control measures.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Expert Recruitment:</strong>The section describes the multi-channel recruitment process, targeting NLP researchers through various platforms like Slack, Twitter, and in-person events at conferences. It highlights the screening criteria based on publication records at major AI venues.</li><li><strong>Expert Qualifications:</strong>The section emphasizes the high qualifications of the recruited experts, providing statistics on their academic positions, institutional affiliations, and research profile metrics like publications, citations, and h-index.</li><li><strong>Idea Writing:</strong>The section outlines the idea writing task, reporting statistics on participants&#x27; familiarity with the chosen topic, perceived difficulty, time spent, and the length of their written ideas.</li><li><strong>Idea Reviewing:</strong>The section details the idea reviewing process, explaining the assignment procedure based on reviewers&#x27; preferred topics and workload, the anonymization of ideas, and the balancing of conditions and institutions to minimize bias.</li><li><strong>Review Quality Check:</strong>The section presents statistics on reviewers&#x27; familiarity with the topic, confidence in their reviews, time spent, and review length, comparing them to ICLR 2024 reviews as a baseline. It also highlights the inclusion of external paper links in rationales as an indicator of review quality.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Rigorous Recruitment and Screening</strong>
        <p>The section demonstrates a rigorous approach to expert recruitment and screening, ensuring the participation of highly qualified NLP researchers with relevant publication records. The multi-channel recruitment strategy and the use of Google Scholar profiles for screening contribute to the study&#x27;s credibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We performed screening on all the US participants 6 based on their provided Google Scholar profiles. We set a minimum requirement of having published at least one paper at a major AI venue. 7 We reached out to all participants who satisfied this requirement with the consent form and followed up with the annotation documents for those who consented to participate." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Description of Expert Qualifications</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive overview of the expert participants&#x27; qualifications, including their academic positions, institutional affiliations, and research profile metrics. This detailed description enhances the transparency of the study and allows readers to assess the expertise of the participants.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our pool of participants is highly qualified and diverse. The 49 idea writers come from 26 different institutions (Table 15) and the majority of them are current PhD students (Figure 3 left). The 79 reviewers come from 32 institutions (Table 16) and are mostly PhD students and Postdocs (Figure 3 right). We use their Google Scholar profiles to extract several proxy metrics, including the number of papers, citations, h-index, and i10-index at the time of their submission. Table 2 shows that our idea writers have an average of 12 papers and 477 citations, while every reviewer has published at least two papers and has an average citation of 635 and h-index of 7." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Thorough Quality Control Measures</strong>
        <p>The section outlines several quality control measures implemented in both the idea writing and reviewing stages. These measures, such as standardizing instructions, using a structured template, and checking for review quality indicators, enhance the reliability and validity of the collected data.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Review Assignment We let all reviewer participants select their top two preferred topics as well as their preferred reviewing load (from 2 to 7). We then randomly assign them to ideas within their selected topics and all ideas are anonymized. In the assignment, we balance the number of ideas from each condition for each reviewer and ensure that each reviewer gets at least one human idea and one AI idea. Every idea is reviewed by 2 to 4 different reviewers. We also avoid assigning ideas written by authors from the same institution to avoid any potential contamination. Table 5 shows that each reviewer wrote an average of 3.8 reviews from 2 or 3 conditions, across 1 to 3 topics." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Potential Experimenter Bias</strong>
        <p>While the section emphasizes the qualifications and diversity of the participants, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly address potential experimenter bias in the recruitment or task instructions. Acknowledging and discussing potential biases would strengthen the study&#x27;s methodological rigor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Transparency about potential experimenter bias is crucial for ensuring the objectivity of the study. It allows readers to critically evaluate the influence of the researchers&#x27; expectations or preferences on the study&#x27;s design and outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing potential sources of experimenter bias in the recruitment process, task instructions, or data analysis. Outline steps taken to mitigate these biases, such as using standardized procedures, blinding reviewers to the source of ideas, and involving multiple researchers in data analysis.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Review Assignment Details</strong>
        <p>The section mentions balancing conditions and institutions in the review assignment but could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the specific procedures used. Clarifying these details would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the review process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In the assignment, we balance the number of ideas from each condition for each reviewer and ensure that each reviewer gets at least one human idea and one AI idea. Every idea is reviewed by 2 to 4 different reviewers. We also avoid assigning ideas written by authors from the same institution to avoid any potential contamination. Table 5 shows that each reviewer wrote an average of 3.8 reviews from 2 or 3 conditions, across 1 to 3 topics." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing a more detailed account of the review assignment process would allow readers to better understand how potential biases were minimized and how the reviewers&#x27; expertise was matched to the assigned ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a subsection or appendix describing the specific algorithm or procedure used for review assignment. Explain how the system ensures balance across conditions, institutions, and reviewer expertise. Provide examples or visualizations to illustrate the assignment process.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Ethical Considerations of Idea Ownership</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on the practical aspects of idea writing and reviewing but doesn&#x27;t explicitly address the ethical considerations of idea ownership, particularly when AI is involved. Discussing these implications would contribute to a more responsible and ethical approach to AI-assisted research.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> As AI plays an increasing role in idea generation, it&#x27;s crucial to establish clear ethical guidelines regarding idea ownership and intellectual credit. Addressing these considerations proactively can prevent potential disputes and ensure fair recognition of contributions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the ethical implications of AI-generated ideas, particularly regarding ownership and intellectual credit. Explore different perspectives on how to attribute credit when AI is involved in the ideation process. Propose guidelines or recommendations for researchers using AI tools for idea generation, emphasizing transparency and responsible use.</p>

            <h3>Main Result: AI Ideas Are Rated More Novel Than Expert Ideas</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the main finding of the study: AI-generated research ideas are rated as significantly more novel than human expert ideas. The authors use three different statistical tests to account for potential confounders like multiple reviews per idea and reviewer biases. All three tests consistently show that AI ideas receive higher novelty scores, supporting the claim that LLMs can generate more novel research ideas.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Statistical Significance:</strong>The results demonstrate a statistically significant difference in novelty scores between AI-generated ideas and human-written ideas (p &lt; 0.05).</li><li><strong>Multiple Statistical Tests:</strong>Three different tests are employed to address potential confounders and ensure the robustness of the findings. Test 1 treats each review as independent, Test 2 averages scores per idea, and Test 3 analyzes mean score differences per reviewer.</li><li><strong>Consistency Across Tests:</strong>All three tests consistently show that AI ideas are rated as more novel than human ideas, strengthening the validity of the conclusion.</li><li><strong>Other Metrics:</strong>While AI ideas excel in novelty, they are comparable to human ideas on other metrics like excitement, feasibility, and expected effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Potential Feasibility Trade-off:</strong>The results hint at a possible trade-off, with AI ideas potentially being slightly weaker in feasibility compared to human ideas, though this requires further investigation.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Rigorous Statistical Analysis</strong>
        <p>The authors employ three different statistical tests to address potential confounders and ensure the robustness of their findings. This thorough approach strengthens the validity of the conclusion regarding the superior novelty of AI-generated ideas.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Consistently across three different statistical tests accounting for the possible confounders, we find that AI ideas have higher novelty scores than human ideas while being comparable on all other metrics." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Presentation of Results</strong>
        <p>The results are presented clearly and concisely, using tables and figures to effectively convey the key findings. The use of statistical significance markers and descriptive statistics enhances the readability and interpretability of the data.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We show the barplot in Figure 2 and the detailed numerical results in Table 7. Both AI Ideas (µ = 5.64±σ = 1.76) and AI Ideas + Human Rerank (µ = 5.81 ± σ = 1.66) are significantly better than Human Ideas (µ = 4.84 ± σ = 1.79) on the novelty score (p &lt; 0.01)." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Transparency in Methodology</strong>
        <p>The authors provide a detailed explanation of each statistical test, outlining the rationale, data processing steps, and statistical methods used. This transparency allows readers to understand the reasoning behind the analysis and assess the validity of the conclusions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Since we collect multiple reviews for each idea, one could argue that we should not treat each review as an independent datapoint. To account for this potential confounder, we perform Test 2 where we average the scores of each idea and treat each idea as one datapoint." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Effect Sizes</strong>
        <p>While the results demonstrate statistical significance, the section would benefit from reporting effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of the difference in novelty scores between AI and human ideas. This would provide a more practical understanding of the observed effect.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Both AI Ideas (µ = 5.64±σ = 1.76) and AI Ideas + Human Rerank (µ = 5.81 ± σ = 1.66) are significantly better than Human Ideas (µ = 4.84 ± σ = 1.79) on the novelty score (p &lt; 0.01)." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Reporting effect sizes would complement the statistical significance findings, providing a more informative and nuanced understanding of the practical significance of the observed difference in novelty.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Calculate and report appropriate effect sizes, such as Cohen&#x27;s d or Hedges&#x27; g, for the difference in novelty scores between AI and human ideas. Discuss the interpretation of these effect sizes in the context of the study&#x27;s findings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate Feasibility Trade-off</strong>
        <p>The section mentions a potential feasibility trade-off with AI ideas, but this aspect is not explored in detail. Further investigation into this trade-off, including qualitative analysis of reviewer comments and potential strategies for mitigating feasibility concerns, would provide valuable insights.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We find some signs that these gains are correlated with excitement and overall score, and may come at the slight expense of feasibility, but our study size did not have sufficient power to conclusively identify these effects (Figure 2)." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the feasibility trade-off is crucial for assessing the practical implications of using LLMs for research ideation. It would inform the development of more balanced ideation systems that prioritize both novelty and feasibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct a qualitative analysis of reviewer comments on the feasibility of AI-generated ideas, identifying common concerns and potential areas for improvement. Explore strategies for incorporating feasibility considerations into the LLM agent, such as prompting for implementation details or using constraints to guide idea generation towards more practical solutions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Limitations of Novelty Assessment</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on the quantitative assessment of novelty but doesn&#x27;t explicitly discuss the limitations of this approach. Acknowledging the inherent subjectivity of novelty judgments and potential biases in human evaluations would enhance the study&#x27;s critical reflection.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Recognizing the limitations of novelty assessment is crucial for interpreting the study&#x27;s findings and avoiding overgeneralizations. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in evaluating research ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or subsection discussing the limitations of novelty assessment, acknowledging the subjectivity of human judgments and potential biases. Explore alternative approaches to evaluating novelty, such as using objective measures of originality or comparing ideas to a comprehensive database of existing research.</p>

For instance, the &#x27;Novelty Score&#x27; for &#x27;Human Ideas&#x27; has a size of 119, a mean of 4.84, a median of 5, a standard deviation of 1.79, a standard error of 0.16, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 8. The p-values, calculated using two-tailed Welch&#x27;s t-tests with Bonferroni correction, are used to assess statistical significance. Statistically significant p-values are highlighted: p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**), p &lt; 0.001 (***). AI-generated ideas, with or without human reranking, consistently score higher in &#x27;Novelty&#x27; and &#x27;Excitement&#x27; compared to &#x27;Human Ideas&#x27;, with statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.001). While scores for other metrics appear similar across conditions, only the &#x27;Overall Score&#x27; for &#x27;AI Ideas + Human Rerank&#x27; shows a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.04*) compared to &#x27;Human Ideas&#x27;.</p>

For each comparison, the table provides the number of reviewers (N), the mean difference in scores, and the p-value calculated using one-sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Statistically significant p-values (p &lt; 0.05) are highlighted in bold, indicating a significant difference between AI and human ideas in those aspects. The table shows that AI ideas, both with and without human reranking, are rated significantly more novel and exciting than human ideas. This finding, consistent across all three statistical tests, further supports the conclusion that AI-generated ideas are judged as more novel than human expert-generated ideas.</p>

            <h3>In-Depth Analysis of the Human Study</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section delves deeper into the human study results, exploring nuances beyond the main finding that AI-generated ideas are rated as more novel. It examines the quality of human ideas, reviewer preferences, and the level of agreement among reviewers. The section highlights that human experts might not have submitted their best ideas, reviewers tend to prioritize novelty and excitement, and reviewing research ideas, especially without seeing the actual results, is inherently subjective.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Human Idea Quality:</strong>The section investigates whether human experts submitted their best ideas, finding that most ideas were generated on the spot and considered to be around the top 43% of their past research ideas.</li><li><strong>Reviewer Preferences:</strong>Analysis of pairwise correlations between review metrics reveals that reviewers tend to focus more on novelty and excitement when evaluating ideas, with the overall score highly correlated with these two metrics.</li><li><strong>Reviewer Agreement:</strong>The section acknowledges the subjectivity of reviewing research ideas and examines inter-reviewer agreement. It finds a relatively low agreement (56.1%) compared to conference reviewing, suggesting the inherent subjectivity of evaluating ideas without seeing the actual experiment results.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Exploring Nuances Beyond Main Finding</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply reporting the main result and explores additional aspects of the human study, providing a more nuanced understanding of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"While the above main results highlight the promise of LLMs in generating novel research ideas, there are some additional nuances. In this section, we move beyond the statistical comparisons and dive into other aspects of our collected data. Specifically, we focus on the quality of human ideas, reviewer preferences, and the extent of reviewer agreement." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Investigating Human Idea Quality</strong>
        <p>The section critically examines the quality of human-generated ideas, recognizing that the submitted ideas might not represent the experts&#x27; best work due to time constraints and the on-the-spot nature of the task.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We first investigate whether human experts are submitting their best ideas to us. We did a poststudy survey to understand how idea-writing participants came up with their ideas. Out of the 49 participants, 37 of them came up with the idea on the spot, while the other 12 already had the idea before the study." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Analyzing Reviewer Preferences</strong>
        <p>The section analyzes reviewer preferences by examining correlations between review metrics, revealing a tendency to prioritize novelty and excitement over feasibility. This insight provides valuable information about the factors influencing reviewers&#x27; judgments.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics between the different metrics in the review process, we explore whether reviewers focus on specific aspects when evaluating the ideas. We compute the pairwise correlation between different metrics in Table 10. The overall score mostly correlates with the novelty score (r = 0.725) and excitement score (r = 0.854), while having almost no correlation (r &lt; 0.1) with the feasibility score. This implies that reviewers might be paying more attention to the novelty and excitement aspects of the ideas when they are reviewing." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Implications of Reviewer Preferences</strong>
        <p>The section identifies reviewer preferences but could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of these preferences for the evaluation of research ideas. Specifically, it would be valuable to explore how the prioritization of novelty and excitement might affect the assessment of feasibility and the overall balance between these criteria.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This implies that reviewers might be paying more attention to the novelty and excitement aspects of the ideas when they are reviewing." (Page 12)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the implications of reviewer preferences is crucial for interpreting the study&#x27;s findings and for developing more balanced evaluation frameworks that consider both novelty and feasibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the potential consequences of prioritizing novelty and excitement in research idea evaluation. Explore how this might lead to overlooking potentially impactful but less exciting ideas or to overestimating the feasibility of novel but challenging concepts. Suggest strategies for mitigating these biases, such as explicitly weighting different criteria or providing reviewers with guidelines that emphasize the importance of considering both novelty and feasibility.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Limitations of Inter-Reviewer Agreement Metric</strong>
        <p>The section reports a relatively low inter-reviewer agreement but doesn&#x27;t explicitly discuss the limitations of the metric used. Acknowledging potential issues with the metric, such as its sensitivity to the number of reviewers or the distribution of scores, would enhance the study&#x27;s methodological transparency.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Specifically, we randomly split reviewers of each paper into half, use one half to rank the top and bottom 25% of all ideas, and then measure agreement with the held-out set of reviewers. 11 As shown in the first block of Table 11, reviewers have a relatively low agreement (56.1%) despite the fact that we have provided detailed explanations for each metric in our review form." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Transparency about the limitations of the inter-reviewer agreement metric is crucial for interpreting the findings and for avoiding overgeneralizations about the level of agreement among reviewers. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in measuring agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or footnote discussing the limitations of the inter-reviewer agreement metric used. Explain how the metric might be affected by factors like the number of reviewers, the distribution of scores, or the specific task being evaluated. Explore alternative metrics or approaches to measuring agreement, such as Cohen&#x27;s kappa or Fleiss&#x27; kappa, and discuss their potential advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect Subjectivity to Feasibility Concerns</strong>
        <p>The section acknowledges the subjectivity of reviewing research ideas but doesn&#x27;t explicitly connect this subjectivity to the potential feasibility concerns raised earlier. Exploring this connection would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges in evaluating research ideas, particularly those generated by AI.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Finally, we acknowledge that reviewing is inherently subjective, and reviewing based on ideas rather than executed papers might be even more subjective." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Connecting subjectivity to feasibility concerns would highlight the inherent difficulty in assessing the practicality of novel ideas, especially when the evaluation is based solely on a written proposal. It would emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods that consider both the novelty and feasibility of research ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing how the subjectivity of reviewing research ideas might contribute to the observed feasibility concerns with AI-generated ideas. Explore how reviewers&#x27; interpretations of feasibility might vary depending on their background, expertise, or risk tolerance. Suggest strategies for mitigating these subjective biases, such as providing reviewers with clear guidelines for assessing feasibility, incorporating objective measures of resource requirements, or involving experts from different disciplines in the evaluation process.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of LLMs</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section shifts the focus from the human study to the limitations of LLMs in research idea generation. It challenges the assumption that simply scaling up idea generation with LLMs will lead to higher quality ideas. The section identifies two key limitations: a lack of diversity in LLM-generated ideas and the unreliability of LLMs in evaluating ideas.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Lack of Diversity:</strong>Despite generating a large number of ideas, LLMs tend to produce many duplicates, limiting the diversity and novelty of the idea pool. Analysis shows that the percentage of non-duplicate ideas decreases as the LLM generates more ideas, eventually reaching a plateau.</li><li><strong>Unreliable Evaluation:</strong>LLMs are found to be unreliable in evaluating research ideas, even when using pairwise comparison methods trained on review data. Their agreement with human reviewers is lower than the inter-reviewer consistency among humans, raising concerns about using LLMs as a substitute for human judgment in evaluating research ideas.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Critical Examination of Assumptions</strong>
        <p>The section challenges the common assumption that simply scaling up LLM-based idea generation will lead to better results. It provides empirical evidence to demonstrate the limitations of this approach, highlighting the need for more nuanced strategies.</p>
        <div class="quote">"With our findings from the human study in mind, we now turn to LLM performance to provide insights that could inform future methods for improving idea generation systems. Our ideation agent is motivated by two potential strengths of LLMs: their ability to scale by generating a vast number of ideas - far more than any human could - and the possibility of filtering these ideas to extract the best ones from the large pool. In theory, this approach could lead to high-quality ideas by leveraging inference scaling. However, we present empirical evidence that this naive assumption about scaling idea generation has significant limitations." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Empirical Evidence for Limitations</strong>
        <p>The section supports its claims about LLM limitations with empirical evidence, analyzing the duplication rate in generated ideas and comparing LLM evaluation performance to human reviewers. This data-driven approach strengthens the arguments and provides a basis for future research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In Figure 4, we show that as the agent keeps generating new batches of ideas, the percentage of non-duplicates in newly generated batches keeps decreasing, and the accumulated non-duplicate ideas eventually plateau. In fact, out of the 4000 generated seed ideas, there are only 200 non-duplicate unique ideas. This sets a bottleneck on our inference-time scaling since increasing the number of generated ideas simply leads to repeating duplicate ideas." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Addressing Concerns about LLM-as-a-Judge</strong>
        <p>The section directly addresses the growing trend of using LLMs as a substitute for human reviewers, providing evidence that LLMs are not yet reliable in this role. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on LLM-based evaluation and emphasizes the importance of human judgment in assessing research ideas.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Most prior works have adopted LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating research ideas (Lu et al., 2024) motivated by the observation that LLMs can have a higher agreement with human evaluators than the inter-human agreement. However, we offer some empirical evidence that LLMs cannot evaluate ideas reliably yet." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate Causes of Duplication</strong>
        <p>While the section identifies the lack of diversity as a limitation, it doesn&#x27;t delve into the potential causes of this duplication. Exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon could lead to more effective strategies for mitigating it.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This sets a bottleneck on our inference-time scaling since increasing the number of generated ideas simply leads to repeating duplicate ideas." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the underlying causes of duplication is crucial for developing targeted solutions. It could reveal whether the issue stems from limitations in the LLM&#x27;s training data, the prompting strategy, or the inherent nature of the task.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct a systematic analysis of the duplicated ideas, examining their common features, patterns, and relationships to the input prompts and retrieved papers. Explore different prompting strategies, such as encouraging novelty or explicitly discouraging repetition, to assess their impact on duplication rates. Investigate the role of the LLM&#x27;s training data, particularly its diversity and coverage of research topics, in influencing the generation of unique ideas.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Develop Strategies for Promoting Diversity</strong>
        <p>The section highlights the need for diversity but doesn&#x27;t offer concrete suggestions for promoting it. Exploring specific strategies for encouraging the generation of more diverse and novel ideas would be valuable for future research.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Developing effective strategies for promoting diversity is crucial for realizing the full potential of LLMs in research ideation. It would enable the generation of a wider range of ideas, leading to more innovative and impactful research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate diversity-promoting sampling techniques during idea generation, such as top-k sampling or nucleus sampling, to encourage the exploration of less likely but potentially more novel ideas. Explore prompt engineering techniques that explicitly encourage the LLM to consider different perspectives, challenge existing assumptions, or combine concepts from different domains. Develop methods for incorporating feedback from human experts or external knowledge sources to guide the LLM towards more diverse and creative solutions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Ethical Implications of LLM Limitations</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on the technical limitations of LLMs but doesn&#x27;t explicitly address the ethical implications of these limitations. Discussing the potential consequences of relying on LLMs with limited diversity and unreliable evaluation capabilities would contribute to a more responsible and ethical approach to AI-assisted research.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging the ethical implications of LLM limitations is crucial for ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and do not exacerbate existing biases or hinder scientific progress. It encourages a more critical and nuanced perspective on the role of AI in research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the ethical implications of LLM limitations, particularly regarding the potential for reinforcing existing biases, hindering the exploration of diverse perspectives, and undermining the credibility of research findings. Emphasize the importance of human oversight, critical evaluation of LLM outputs, and the development of guidelines for responsible use of these technologies in research.</p>

        <p>Figure 4, titled &#x27;Measuring duplication of AI-generated ideas&#x27;, consists of two line graphs illustrating the prevalence of duplicate ideas generated by the AI agent. The left graph, titled &#x27;Evolution of Non-Duplicates (%) Across Generations&#x27;, plots the percentage of non-duplicate ideas in each new batch of generated ideas. The x-axis represents the &#x27;Total Number of Ideas Generated&#x27;, ranging from 0 to 4000, while the y-axis represents the &#x27;Non-Duplicate Percentage (%)&#x27;, ranging from 0 to 100. The graph shows a decreasing trend, indicating that as more ideas are generated, the proportion of unique ideas decreases. The right graph, titled &#x27;Accumulation of Non-Duplicate Ideas Across Generations&#x27;, displays the cumulative number of non-duplicate ideas as the total number of ideas generated increases. The x-axis is the same as the left graph, while the y-axis represents the &#x27;Accumulated Non-Duplicate Ideas&#x27;, ranging from 0 to 200. This graph shows an increasing trend that gradually flattens out, suggesting that while the total number of unique ideas continues to grow, the rate of accumulation slows down significantly.

The first block focuses on inter-reviewer agreement among human reviewers, listing three methods: &#x27;Random&#x27; (50.0% consistency), &#x27;NeurIPS&#x27;21&#x27; (66.0% consistency), &#x27;ICLR&#x27;24&#x27; (71.9% consistency), and &#x27;Ours&#x27; (56.1% consistency). The second block compares the agreement between human reviewers and various AI evaluators, including &#x27;GPT-4o Direct&#x27; (50.0% consistency), &#x27;GPT-4o Pairwise&#x27; (45.0% consistency), &#x27;Claude-3.5 Direct&#x27; (51.7% consistency), &#x27;Claude-3.5 Pairwise&#x27; (53.3% consistency), and &#x27;&quot;AI Scientist&quot; Reviewer&#x27; (43.3% consistency).</p>

            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "As shown in the first block of Table 11, reviewers have a relatively low agreement (56.1%) despite the fact that we have provided detailed explanations for each metric in our review form."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This sentence, found in the &#x27;LLMs Cannot Evaluate Ideas Reliably&#x27; subsection, introduces Table 11 to present data on inter-reviewer agreement among human reviewers, highlighting the relatively low consistency despite efforts to standardize the review process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Table 11 is relevant to the section&#x27;s argument about the limitations of LLMs as reliable evaluators of research ideas. It shows that even the best-performing AI evaluator (Claude-3.5 Pairwise) achieves a lower agreement with human reviewers than the inter-reviewer consistency among humans. This finding challenges the notion that LLMs can effectively replace human judgment in evaluating research ideas, particularly in complex and subjective tasks.</p>

        <strong>Qualitative Insights from Reviews</strong>
        <p>The section effectively uses qualitative analysis of free-text reviews to provide a deeper understanding of the quantitative findings. It goes beyond simply reporting numerical scores and delves into the reviewers&#x27; reasoning and specific observations about the strengths and weaknesses of both human and AI-generated ideas.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Following recent practices of using LLMs to extract patterns from text corpora (Zhong et al., 2022, 2023), we use Claude-3.5 to extract and cluster the main points from all reviews. We then manually verified and labeled each cluster." (Page 16)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Identification of Failure Modes</strong>
        <p>The section provides a valuable contribution by identifying common failure modes of AI-generated ideas. This analysis highlights specific areas where LLMs struggle in research ideation, offering insights for future research and development.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Next, we summarize some common failure modes of AI ideas:" (Page 16)</div>

        <strong>Expand on Ethical Implications</strong>
        <p>While the section analyzes the quality and characteristics of ideas, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly address the ethical implications of using LLMs for research ideation. Discussing potential concerns, such as bias in AI-generated ideas or the impact on human creativity, would enhance the section&#x27;s societal relevance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing ethical considerations is crucial in AI research, demonstrating the authors&#x27; awareness of potential societal impacts and fostering responsible development and use of LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the ethical implications of LLM-based idea generation. Address potential biases in LLM outputs, the importance of human oversight, and the need for guidelines to ensure responsible use of these technologies in research.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Context for Case Studies</strong>
        <p>The section presents case studies of randomly sampled ideas but provides limited context for these examples. Including a brief summary of the research problem, the proposed approach, and the key findings from the reviews would enhance the readers&#x27; understanding and engagement with these examples.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We randomly sample four pairs of ideas from different topics to ground our numerical results with actual examples. In each pair, there is one AI idea and one human idea. To save space, we include the full project proposal of each idea along with the full set of reviews in the Appendix, but we list their titles, topics, and average scores here for quick reference (we reveal whether each idea is AI-generated or human-written in Appendix X):" (Page 17)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more context for the case studies would make them more informative and engaging for readers. It would allow readers to better understand the specific research problems being addressed, the proposed solutions, and the reviewers&#x27; assessments of these ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each case study, add a paragraph or two summarizing the research problem, the proposed approach, and the key findings from the reviews. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each idea, drawing connections to the general patterns identified in the analysis of free-text reviews.</p>
    </li>

        <div class="quote">"Research idea generation and execution. Several prior works explored methods to improve idea generation, such as iterative novelty boosting (Wang et al., 2024), multi-agent collaboration (Baek et al., 2024), and multi-module retrieval and revision (Yang et al., 2024). While some of them share similar components as our ideation agent, these works focus on improving the idea generation methods over vanilla prompting baselines, without comparisons to any human expert baselines. Beyond ideation, another line of work uses LLMs for executing experiments by generating code given the research problems (Huang et al., 2024, Tian et al., 2024), or combining idea generation with code generation to directly implement AI-generated ideas (Li et al., 2024, Lu et al., 2024). These works either use automatic evaluation on a pre-defined set of problems and benchmarks, setting a constrained problem space; or rely on proxy metrics like LLM evaluators, which are often unreliable."

        <div class="quote">"Our work also connects to the line of work on examining AI’s novelty and diversity in creative tasks. Chakrabarty et al. (2024) found that AI writings are less creative than professional writers, while we show LLM-generated ideas can be more novel than experts on the task of research ideation. Another line of work found that LLM generations lack collective diversity (Anderson et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2024), which matches our findings on idea generation. Lastly, several other works conducted human evaluation to study the impact of AI exposure or humanAI collaboration on novelty and diversity (Ashkinaze et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2024, Padmakumar and He, 2024) with mixed conclusions. While we also conduct a human evaluation of idea novelty, we focus on the human-AI comparison on the challenging task of research ideation with expert participants." (Page 18)</div>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section reflects on the study&#x27;s findings and addresses potential questions regarding the quality of human ideas, the subjectivity of idea evaluation, the choice of focusing on prompting-based NLP research, and the possibility of automating idea execution. It also acknowledges the limitations of the current study, proposing future research directions to address these limitations. The section emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of AI-generated ideas by executing them into full projects and extending the study to other research domains.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Quality of Human Ideas:</strong>The section acknowledges that the human-generated ideas might not represent the experts&#x27; best work due to time constraints and the on-the-spot nature of the task. It proposes a future experiment comparing AI ideas with papers accepted at top-tier AI conferences to address this concern.</li><li><strong>Subjectivity of Idea Evaluation:</strong>The section recognizes the inherent subjectivity of evaluating ideas based solely on proposals and proposes a follow-up study where researchers execute both AI and human-generated ideas into full projects to enable a more reliable evaluation based on actual outcomes.</li><li><strong>Focus on Prompting-Based NLP Research:</strong>The section justifies the choice of focusing on prompting-based NLP research due to its relevance, impact, executability, and suitability for follow-up experiments.

        <strong>Addressing Potential Concerns</strong>
        <p>The section effectively addresses potential concerns and questions that readers might have regarding the study&#x27;s design, findings, and scope. It acknowledges the limitations of the current study and proposes concrete steps to address these limitations in future research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To summarize, we compared research ideas generated by our AI agent with ideas written by expert researchers, and observed the robust finding that expert reviewers rate AI ideas as statistically more novel than expert ideas. In this section, we discuss some high-level questions readers might have and suggest some ways to address them." (Page 19)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Proposing Future Research Directions</strong>
        <p>The section outlines clear and specific future research directions, building upon the findings and limitations of the current study. It proposes a multi-phase approach, moving from idea evaluation to idea execution and expanding the scope to other research domains.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Question 2: Are evaluations based solely on ideas subjective? In this current study, we focused solely on evaluating the ideas themselves. Ideas that sound novel and exciting might not necessarily turn into successful projects, and our results indeed indicated some feasibility trade-offs of AI ideas. We view the current study as a preliminary evaluation of AI-generated ideas. In the next phase, we will recruit researchers to execute some AI and human-generated ideas into full projects. This will enable reviewers to assess the complete experimental outcomes, providing a more reliable basis for evaluation. Furthermore, it will allow us to analyze whether our initial idea evaluations align with the assessments of the actual project outcomes." (Page 19)</div>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Ethical Implications of Idea Execution</strong>
        <p>While the section proposes executing AI-generated ideas, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly address the ethical implications of this process. Discussing potential concerns, such as the potential for unintended consequences or the responsibility for outcomes, would enhance the section&#x27;s ethical awareness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Executing AI-generated ideas raises ethical questions regarding the potential for unforeseen consequences, the allocation of responsibility for outcomes, and the impact on the research process. Addressing these concerns proactively is crucial for ensuring the responsible development and use of AI in research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a paragraph or subsection discussing the ethical implications of executing AI-generated ideas. Explore potential risks, such as the possibility of generating harmful or unethical research, the challenges in attributing responsibility for outcomes, and the impact on the role of human researchers in the execution process. Propose guidelines or principles for responsible idea execution, emphasizing the need for human oversight, ethical review, and consideration of potential societal impacts.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Challenges of Automating Idea Execution</strong>
        <p>The section briefly mentions the challenges of automating idea execution but could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the specific difficulties encountered, such as ensuring code correctness, handling unexpected errors, and evaluating the faithfulness of implementations. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in this task.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We have also explored building an LLM agent to generate code to implement the generated ideas. Specifically, we provide a template codebase that consists of: (1) loading datasets from Huggingface or generating synthetic test examples; (2) implementing baseline methods; (3) implementing the proposed method; (3) loading or implementing the evaluation metrics; (4) running experiments on the testset with the baselines and the proposed method, so that the output of the agent will be a report of the baseline performance as well as the proposed method’s performance. While this agent can generate code that compiles and executes, we find that the automated experiments can be misleading because the agent often skips or modifies steps in the baselines or proposed methods. In some cases, the metric functions are also not correctly defined. This highlights the core challenge: just comparing the final experiment results is not enough; we have to verify the faithfulness of the implementations as well. Performing such implementation verification is not a trivial task, and we leave it to future work. We provide detailed description of our idea execution agent in Appendix Y." (Page 19)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of the challenges in automating idea execution would highlight the limitations of current approaches and guide future research efforts towards developing more robust and reliable execution agents. It would also emphasize the need for careful consideration of the technical complexities involved in this task.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider adding a subsection or paragraph specifically focusing on the challenges of automating idea execution. Discuss specific difficulties encountered, such as ensuring code correctness, handling unexpected errors, evaluating the faithfulness of implementations, and addressing the potential for bias in code generation. Explore potential solutions, such as incorporating formal verification techniques, developing more sophisticated error handling mechanisms, and using human-in-the-loop approaches to validate code and ensure implementation fidelity.</p>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Ethical Analysis</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive analysis of the ethical implications of using AI for research idea generation, covering a wide range of concerns from publication ethics to the impact on human researchers.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The growing use of AI to generate research ideas raises serious concerns about the potential abuse of these technologies by students or researchers who may flood academic conferences with low-quality or poorly thought-out submissions." (Page 20)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Responsible Use</strong>
        <p>The section consistently emphasizes the need for responsible use of AI in research, advocating for transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations in all stages of the research process.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To prevent this, it is essential to hold researchers accountable for the outputs generated through AI tools. Rigorous standards must be applied equally to both AI-assisted and human-generated research to ensure that the use of LLMs does not result in misleading, superficial, or unethical academic contributions." (Page 20)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concrete Recommendations</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply raising concerns and provides concrete recommendations for mitigating ethical risks, such as transparent documentation practices, safety research, and exploring new forms of human-AI collaboration.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Researchers should clearly disclose the role AI played in the idea generation process, specifying which models, data sources, and frameworks were used, and outlining the level of human involvement. This could ensure that the credit distribution in AI-supported research is as transparent and fair as possible." (Page 20)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
