        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This study found a correlation between higher plant-to-animal protein ratios and reduced CVD (HR 0.81) and CAD (HR 0.73) risk in three large US cohorts over 30 years. No association was found with stroke. Substituting red/processed meat with plant protein, especially nuts, showed the greatest benefit. The association was stronger with higher protein density. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the observational design and reliance on FFQs.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This analysis of prospective cohort studies suggests a correlation between higher plant-to-animal protein ratios and reduced CVD/CAD risk, but not stroke. While the large sample size, long follow-up, and sensitivity analyses are strengths, the observational nature limits causal inference. Residual confounding and reliance on FFQs are key limitations. Substituting red/processed meat with plant protein, especially nuts, appears most beneficial. However, translating these findings into practical dietary advice requires caution. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to confirm causality and establish optimal P:A ratios for diverse populations. While the findings support existing recommendations to favor plant protein, individual dietary needs and preferences should be considered.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Plant-to-Animal Protein Ratio and CVD Risk:</strong> The study investigates the relationship between the dietary plant-to-animal protein ratio (P:A ratio) and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Imagine your diet as a scale, with plant protein on one side and animal protein on the other. The P:A ratio represents the balance between these two. The researchers wanted to see if tilting the scale towards plant protein is linked to a lower risk of heart problems.</li><li><strong>Study Population and Design:</strong> Three large prospective cohort studies were used: the Nurses&#x27; Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). These studies track the health of participants over many years, allowing researchers to observe how dietary habits, like the P:A ratio, relate to the development of diseases like CVD. Think of it like a long-term nature documentary, observing the lives of these individuals and noting any patterns.</li><li><strong>Dietary Assessment:</strong> Dietary intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) every four years. Participants reported how often they consumed specific foods, allowing researchers to estimate their P:A ratio. It&#x27;s like taking snapshots of their diet at regular intervals.</li><li><strong>Association of P:A Ratio with CVD and CAD:</strong> The study found that a higher P:A ratio was associated with a lower risk of CVD and coronary artery disease (CAD), but not stroke. This suggests that shifting the protein balance towards plants may protect against certain heart problems. It&#x27;s like discovering that adding more fruits and vegetables to your plate can boost your health.</li><li><strong>Joint Effect of P:A Ratio and Protein Density:</strong> The greatest benefit was observed when higher P:A ratios were combined with higher overall protein density (percentage of total calories from protein). This means that not only the source of protein but also the total amount matters. It&#x27;s like realizing that regular exercise is most effective when combined with a balanced diet.</li><li><strong>Substitution Analyses and Beneficial Plant Protein Sources:</strong> Substitution analyses, which statistically model the replacement of animal protein with plant protein, suggested that replacing red and processed meat with plant protein sources, particularly nuts, offered the most significant cardiovascular benefit. This highlights the importance of not just increasing plant protein but also choosing the right sources. It&#x27;s like swapping out sugary snacks for nutritious nuts.</li>

        <strong>Clear summary of key findings</strong>
        <p>The abstract effectively summarizes the main findings of the study, including the inverse association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD/CAD risk, the lack of association with stroke, and the enhanced benefit with higher protein density. This concisely presents the key takeaways for readers.</p>

        <strong>Specify beneficial plant protein sources</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact improvement that would enhance the clarity and precision of the abstract. The abstract should clearly state the specific plant protein sources that showed the greatest benefit when replacing animal protein. This is crucial for readers to understand the practical implications of the study and for informing dietary recommendations. Specifying the sources in the abstract, which serves as a concise overview of the entire study, ensures that this critical information is readily accessible and not buried within the main text. This enhancement would significantly improve the abstract&#x27;s ability to convey the study&#x27;s key findings and their practical relevance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Substitution analyses indicated that replacing red and processed meat with several plant protein sources showed the greatest cardiovascular benefit." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Revise the abstract to explicitly mention the specific plant protein sources (nuts) that were associated with the greatest cardiovascular benefit when substituting for animal protein. For example, &quot;Substitution analyses indicated that replacing red and processed meat with nuts showed the greatest cardiovascular benefit.&quot;</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>CVD and Dietary Protein:</strong> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death, and dietary modifications, such as replacing animal protein with plant protein, are recommended for its prevention. Think of your circulatory system as a network of pipes. CVD is like rust and plaque building up in these pipes, making it harder for blood to flow. Replacing animal protein with plant protein is like using a special cleaning solution to prevent this buildup.</li><li><strong>Unknown Optimal P:A Ratio:</strong> Current dietary guidelines encourage plant protein over animal protein, but the ideal plant-to-animal protein ratio (P:A ratio) for CVD prevention remains unknown. Imagine a seesaw with plant protein on one side and animal protein on the other. We know tilting it towards plant protein is generally good, but we don&#x27;t know the perfect balance point for heart health.</li><li><strong>Study Objective and Design:</strong> This study investigates the association between the P:A ratio and the risk of CVD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke in three large US prospective cohort studies. These studies are like long-term tracking devices, following people&#x27;s diets and health over many years. This helps us see if tilting the protein seesaw affects their chances of developing heart problems.</li><li><strong>P:A Ratio and Protein Density:</strong> The study also examines the combined effects of the P:A ratio and protein density (percentage of calories from protein) on CVD risk. Think of protein density as the concentration of protein in your fuel tank. The study explores whether both the type of protein (plant vs. animal) and the total amount of protein in your diet affect your heart health.</li><li><strong>Substitution Analyses:</strong> Finally, the study uses substitution analyses to estimate the CVD risk associated with replacing specific animal protein sources with plant protein sources. Imagine swapping out different parts of your engine (red meat, poultry, dairy) with plant-based alternatives. This analysis helps us understand which swaps are most beneficial for your heart.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Effective context and rationale establishment</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context and rationale for the study by highlighting the global prevalence of CVD and the existing dietary recommendations to replace animal protein with plant protein. This clearly sets the stage for the research question and emphasizes its relevance to public health.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States [1]. Clinical practice guidelines internationally recommend replacing some animal protein with plant protein in the diet to prevent CVD [2,3]." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explicitly state research questions</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact improvement that would strengthen the introduction&#x27;s articulation of the research gap and the study&#x27;s specific contribution. While the introduction mentions the lack of clarity regarding the optimal plant-to-animal protein ratio, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the unanswered questions the study aims to address. Clearly defining these questions would enhance the reader&#x27;s understanding of the study&#x27;s objectives and its contribution to the field. Explicitly stating the research questions would provide a more focused roadmap for the study and enhance its scientific rigor. This would also improve the reader&#x27;s ability to follow the logical flow of the research and appreciate the study&#x27;s contribution to addressing the knowledge gap. The introduction should be revised to include specific research questions, such as, &quot;What is the association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of CVD, CAD, and stroke?&quot; and &quot;What is the joint effect of the plant-to-animal protein ratio and protein density on CVD risk?&quot;</p>
        <div class="quote">"Despite these recommendations, most protein comes from animal sources in developed countries." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Revise the introduction to explicitly state the research questions being investigated. For example, add the following: &quot;This study aims to address the following research questions: 1) What is the association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of CVD, CAD, and stroke? 2) What is the joint effect of the plant-to-animal protein ratio and protein density on CVD risk? 3) How does substituting specific animal protein sources with plant protein sources affect CVD risk?&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide concise methodological overview</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact improvement that would enhance the introduction&#x27;s clarity and provide a more focused overview of the study&#x27;s methodology. While the introduction briefly mentions the use of prospective cohort studies, it lacks a concise summary of the key methodological aspects, such as the specific cohorts used, the duration of follow-up, and the methods for assessing dietary intake and CVD outcomes. Including this information would provide readers with a better understanding of the study&#x27;s design and allow them to quickly grasp the essential methodological details. Providing a concise methodological overview in the introduction would enhance the reader&#x27;s ability to contextualize the study&#x27;s findings and appreciate the strengths and limitations of the chosen approach. This would also improve the flow of the paper by bridging the gap between the rationale and the detailed methods described later. Add a brief summary of the key methodological aspects, including the cohorts (NHS, NHSII, HPFS), follow-up duration (30 years), dietary assessment (FFQs), and CVD outcome ascertainment. For example, &quot;This study utilizes data from three large prospective cohorts (NHS, NHSII, HPFS) with a 30-year follow-up, employing food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess dietary intake and validated criteria to ascertain incident CVD events.&quot;</p>
        <div class="quote">"We, therefore, examined the association between deciles of plant-to-animal protein ratios with CVD in 3 large United States prospective cohort studies" (Page 2)</div>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Population and Cohorts:</strong> This study uses data from three ongoing prospective cohort studies: the Nurses&#x27; Health Study (NHS), the Nurses&#x27; Health Study II (NHSII), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). These cohorts provide a large sample size and long follow-up period, allowing for robust analysis of the association between plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD risk. Imagine these cohorts as three long-running documentaries, capturing the dietary habits and health outcomes of a diverse group of individuals over several decades. This long-term observation is crucial for understanding how dietary patterns influence the development of chronic diseases like CVD.</li><li><strong>Dietary Assessment:</strong> Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered every four years. Participants reported their usual intake of various food items over the past year, allowing researchers to estimate their plant and animal protein consumption. Think of the FFQ as a dietary snapshot taken every four years, capturing the typical eating patterns of the participants. This information is then used to calculate the plant-to-animal protein ratio, which is the key exposure variable in this study.</li><li><strong>Cardiovascular Disease Outcome:</strong> The primary outcome was incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary artery disease, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. These events were ascertained through medical records and other validated methods. CVD is like a plumbing problem in the body&#x27;s circulatory system, where blockages and leaks can lead to serious health consequences. By tracking these events, the researchers can determine if the plant-to-animal protein ratio is associated with a higher or lower risk of developing these plumbing problems.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> The study used Cox proportional hazards regression models to analyze the association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD risk. These models allow researchers to account for the time-varying nature of dietary intake and other risk factors. Imagine each participant&#x27;s journey towards CVD as a race. The Cox model helps us understand how the plant-to-animal protein ratio affects the speed at which participants approach the finish line (CVD event), while also considering other factors that might influence their pace.</li><li><strong>Sensitivity Analyses:</strong> Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. These included using different dietary assessment methods (baseline and most recent ratio), updating dietary information after intermediate disease diagnoses, and adjusting for additional dietary variables. Think of these analyses as stress tests for the study&#x27;s results, ensuring that the observed associations are not due to specific methodological choices or confounding factors. This strengthens the validity and generalizability of the findings.</li><li><strong>Substitution Analyses:</strong> Substitution analyses were performed to estimate the CVD risk associated with replacing specific animal protein sources with plant protein sources. This provides insights into the potential health benefits of dietary changes. Imagine swapping out different ingredients in a recipe. The substitution analyses help us understand how these swaps affect the overall nutritional value and health impact of the dish (diet).</li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Robust study design using prospective cohorts</strong>
        <p>The methods section clearly outlines the study design, including the use of three large, ongoing prospective cohort studies (NHS, NHSII, and HPFS). This design is a strength as it allows for the examination of long-term dietary habits and their association with CVD risk, minimizing recall bias and providing a strong foundation for causal inference.</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Specify FFQ versions and modifications</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact improvement that would enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the dietary assessment methods. While the section mentions the use of a validated FFQ, it lacks specific details about the FFQ versions used in each cohort and any modifications made. Given the evolution of FFQs over time, specifying the version and modifications ensures that other researchers can accurately replicate the dietary assessment and compare findings across studies. Providing these details strengthens the methodological rigor and allows for better comparison with other nutritional epidemiology studies. This would also enhance the reader&#x27;s confidence in the dietary data&#x27;s reliability and validity. The methods section should explicitly state the FFQ versions used in each cohort (NHS, NHSII, HPFS) and detail any modifications made to the standard questionnaires. For instance, &quot;Dietary intake was assessed using validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered every 4 years (NHS: 1984, version X; NHSII: 1991, version Y; HPFS: 1986, version Z). The FFQs were modified to include [specific modifications] and exclude [specific exclusions].&quot;</p>
        <div class="quote">"A validated semiquantitative FFQ was administered every 4 y to determine dietary intake, starting in 1984 in NHS, 1991 in NHSII, and 1986 in HPFS" (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Specify the FFQ versions used in each cohort and detail any modifications made.

        <strong>Provide detailed statistical analysis procedures</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact improvement that would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the statistical analyses. While the section mentions using Cox regressions and restricted cubic splines, it lacks details about the software used and the specific procedures for handling missing data and performing the substitution analyses. Providing these details would strengthen the methodological rigor and allow other researchers to reproduce the analyses and verify the findings. This would also enhance the reader&#x27;s confidence in the statistical methods and the study&#x27;s conclusions. The methods section should specify the statistical software used (SAS version 9.4) and provide detailed steps for handling missing data in the analyses. It should also elaborate on the specific procedures used for the substitution analyses, including the statistical methods and software packages employed. For example, &quot;Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Missing data were handled using [specific method, e.g., multiple imputation]. Substitution analyses were conducted using [specific method and software, e.g., leave-one-nutrient-out model in SAS].&quot;</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Incident CVD Cases and P:A Ratio Trend:</strong> Over 30 years, 16,118 CVD cases (10,187 CAD and 6137 stroke) occurred. The median plant-to-animal protein ratio shifted from ~0.36 (1:3) to ~0.50 (1:2). Imagine a scale with plant and animal protein; the ratio represents the balance. This shift indicates a population-level increase in plant protein relative to animal protein. This change is important because it reflects broader dietary trends and provides context for interpreting the study&#x27;s findings.</li><li><strong>P:A Ratio and CVD/CAD Risk:</strong> Higher plant-to-animal protein ratios were linked to lower CVD and CAD risk, but not stroke risk. Specifically, the highest decile (ratio ~0.76) had a 19% lower CVD risk and 27% lower CAD risk compared to the lowest decile (ratio ~0.24). This key finding suggests that diets richer in plant protein may protect against heart disease. It&#x27;s like discovering that adding more fruits and vegetables to your plate can boost your health.</li><li><strong>Dose-Response Relationship:</strong> The dose-response analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship for CVD and CAD, with steeper risk reductions at lower ratios, plateauing at higher ratios. For stroke, no clear association was found. Imagine a graph where the x-axis is the P:A ratio and the y-axis is the risk. For CVD/CAD, the line curves downwards sharply at first, then flattens. This suggests that initial increases in plant protein have the most significant impact, with diminishing returns at higher levels.</li><li><strong>Joint Effect of P:A Ratio and Protein Density:</strong> Combining higher P:A ratios with higher protein density (calories from protein) amplified the protective effect against CVD and CAD. This suggests that both the type and amount of protein matter. It&#x27;s like realizing that exercise is most effective when combined with a balanced diet.</li><li><strong>Substitution Analyses:</strong> Substitution analyses showed replacing red/processed meat with plant proteins (especially nuts) lowered CVD/CAD risk. This highlights the importance of specific protein swaps. It&#x27;s like swapping out sugary snacks for nutritious nuts.</li><li><strong>Sensitivity Analyses:</strong> Sensitivity analyses using different dietary measures and adjusting for various factors yielded consistent results, strengthening the study&#x27;s robustness. This is like testing a bridge under different loads to ensure its stability.</li><li><strong>Subgroup Analyses:</strong> Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations across demographics and health status, but stronger effects in those with hypercholesterolemia and ever smokers. This suggests that certain groups may benefit more from higher plant protein. It&#x27;s like tailoring a medication dosage based on individual needs.</li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear presentation of key findings</strong>
        <p>The results section effectively presents the key findings of the study, including the inverse association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD/CAD risk, the lack of association with stroke, and the joint effect with protein density. This clear presentation of primary outcomes directly addresses the research questions posed in the introduction.</p>
        <div class="quote">"During 30 y of follow-up, 16,118 incident CVD cases, including 10,187 CAD cases and 6137 stroke cases, were documented." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify clinical significance of findings</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact improvement that would enhance the clarity and interpretability of the results. While the section presents hazard ratios and p-values, it lacks a clear explanation of the clinical significance of these findings. Quantifying the risk reduction in terms of absolute risk or number needed to treat would provide readers with a more practical understanding of the impact of dietary changes on CVD risk. This would also enhance the translational value of the findings for clinicians and public health professionals. Providing this information would strengthen the paper by making the results more relevant to clinical practice and public health interventions. This would also facilitate the communication of the study&#x27;s findings to a broader audience, including patients and policymakers. Ultimately, quantifying the clinical significance of the findings would significantly improve the study&#x27;s impact by providing a more concrete understanding of the potential benefits of dietary changes.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The pooled HRs (95% CIs) in model 3 for CAD was 0.73 (0.67, 0.79; P trend &lt; 0.001)" (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Calculate and report the absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat associated with a higher plant-to-animal protein ratio for CVD and CAD. This can be done using the baseline risk of CVD and CAD in the study population and the hazard ratios reported in the study. For example, &quot;A higher plant-to-animal protein ratio was associated with an absolute risk reduction of X% for CVD and Y% for CAD over 30 years of follow-up. The number needed to treat to prevent one case of CVD/CAD over 30 years was Z.&quot;</p>

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: The graph displays the change in the median plant-to-animal protein ratio over time in three prospective cohort studies: NHS, NHSII, and HPFS. The x-axis represents time (year), spanning from 1982 to 2017. The y-axis represents the plant-to-animal protein ratio, ranging from roughly 0.1 to 0.7. Each cohort is represented by a different colored line (NHS-blue, NHSII -green, HPFS- orange), showing the median ratio at different time points during the follow-up period.</li><li><strong>Technical Terms</strong>: A prospective cohort study is a type of longitudinal research where a group of individuals (the cohort) is followed over time to observe the incidence of a particular outcome (like a disease) and its potential risk factors. The plant-to-animal protein ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of protein consumed from plant sources by the amount consumed from animal sources.</li><li><strong>Ratios and Statistics</strong>: The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when arranged in ascending or descending order. It is used to represent the central tendency of the data. The ratio of ~1:3 signifies that for every one unit of plant protein, three units of animal protein were consumed, and ~1:2 signifies that for every one unit of plant protein, two units of animal protein were consumed. The ratios are calculated based on the energy contribution of these proteins to the diet.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Use of Statistics</strong>: The presentation of median values for the ratio is appropriate for summarizing the central tendency in each cohort. However, providing a measure of variability (e.g., interquartile range) would enhance the interpretation and understanding of the distribution of the ratio within each cohort.</li><li><strong>Data Collection and Limitations</strong>: The secular trend observed in the figure is valuable for demonstrating the dietary shift toward increased plant protein consumption over time. However, the study should clarify how the protein intake data was collected (e.g., food frequency questionnaires) and address potential limitations related to dietary assessment, such as recall bias or measurement error. This is particularly important since dietary assessment is a key aspect of the study.</li><li><strong>Specificity of Protein Sources</strong>: The rationale for focusing on the median plant-to-animal protein ratio is sound. However, exploring the distribution of protein sources within both plant and animal categories would provide additional insights into the types of proteins driving the observed trend. For example, are legumes and nuts replacing red and processed meat or are refined grains and starchy vegetables contributing more to the change?</li></ul>

The use of different colors for different cohorts aids in visual differentiation. The axes are clearly labeled, and the caption provides context.</li><li><strong>Context and Interpretation</strong>: While the figure clearly shows an increasing trend, it could be enhanced by adding a reference line indicating the recommended or optimal ratio, if one exists.

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of participants from three prospective cohort studies (NHS, NHSII, and HPFS) categorized by deciles of their plant-to-animal protein ratio. Deciles divide the participants into ten groups based on their protein ratio, from the lowest (Decile 1) to the highest (Decile 10). Each decile represents 10% of the participants. The characteristics listed include demographic information (age, race/ethnicity), lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol use), health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of myocardial infarction), dietary habits (total energy intake, macronutrient intake, specific food consumption like dairy, red meat, nuts etc., and micronutrient intake), and use of medications (multivitamin and aspirin). The data is presented as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. A plant-to-animal protein ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of protein a person gets from plants by the amount they get from animals.</li><li><strong>Units and Abbreviations</strong>: MET-h/wk refers to Metabolic Equivalent Task-hours per week, a measure of physical activity intensity. AHEI stands for Alternate Healthy Eating Index, a scoring system used to assess diet quality. EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. The &quot;servings/d&quot; for food groups represents the average number of servings consumed per day.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Justification and Methodology</strong>: Presenting baseline characteristics stratified by the exposure variable (plant-to-animal protein ratio) is crucial for assessing potential confounding and identifying any systematic differences between groups. This information helps to support the validity of the subsequent analyses examining the relationship between protein ratio and cardiovascular disease outcomes. The use of deciles is a reasonable approach for categorizing the exposure, allowing for the examination of trends across the range of protein intake ratios. It provides more granular information than simply splitting into two or three groups.</li><li><strong>Missing Data and Confounding</strong>: The authors should clarify how missing data were handled for the baseline characteristics. Were participants with missing values excluded from the analysis? If so, could this exclusion introduce bias? Imputation methods, if used, should be described in detail. It&#x27;s also important to ensure the baseline characteristics are balanced across the deciles, after adjusting for potential confounders in the main analysis.</li><li><strong>Relevance of Included Variables</strong>: The table presents numerous characteristics, some of which may not be directly relevant to the primary research question. The rationale for including each characteristic should be clearly stated, and the authors should consider prioritizing the most relevant variables in the table to enhance clarity and focus.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall Presentation and Clarity</strong>: The table is generally well-organized and presents a comprehensive set of baseline characteristics. The use of standard deviations (SD) provides a measure of variability for continuous variables. The inclusion of both percentages and mean values where appropriate aids in understanding the distribution of characteristics within each decile.</li><li><strong>Missing Ratio Values</strong>: While the table provides deciles of the plant-to-animal protein ratio, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the actual ratio values for each decile. Including these values would make the table more informative and easier to interpret. For instance, instead of just saying &quot;Decile 1&quot;, it would be beneficial to have &quot;Decile 1 (Ratio: 0.21)&quot; or a similar format.</li><li><strong>Visual Presentation and Structure</strong>: The table could benefit from some visual enhancements, such as using boldface for the column headers or adding separators between the different cohorts to improve readability. Additionally, considering the length of the table, splitting it into smaller, more focused tables might improve clarity.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Table 2 displays the association between deciles of plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes (total CVD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke). The table presents hazard ratios (HRs) which indicate the relative risk of developing the outcome in each decile compared to a reference group (Decile 1 - lowest plant-to-animal protein ratio). A HR less than 1 indicates a lower risk, while a HR greater than 1 indicates a higher risk. The table includes results for three different models: age-adjusted (Model 1) and two multivariable-adjusted models (Models 2 and 3) that control for various confounding factors like demographic factors, lifestyle factors, and other health conditions. The table also includes the number of cases and person-years for each outcome. The Plant-to-animal protein ratio is calculated by dividing the energy from plant protein by energy from animal protein. Deciles split the sample population into ten equal groups, from lowest to highest, based on their plant-to-animal protein ratio.</li><li><strong>Statistical Measures</strong>: A hazard ratio (HR) represents the relative risk of an event (in this case, a cardiovascular disease outcome) occurring in one group compared to another group over a specific period of time. A 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values within which the true HR is likely to fall. The p-trend indicates the statistical significance of the trend in HRs across the deciles. Person-years is the sum of the time each participant contributed to the study before experiencing the outcome or dropping out.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Pooling of Data</strong>: Pooling the data from three cohorts increases the statistical power of the analysis and improves the generalizability of the findings. However, the authors should justify the decision to pool the data and discuss any potential heterogeneity between cohorts, such as differences in baseline characteristics or follow-up periods. This could be done by conducting and reporting the results of a heterogeneity test.</li><li><strong>Model Specifications</strong>: The choice of multivariable adjustment models (Models 2 and 3) seems appropriate for controlling for potential confounders. However, the authors should clearly specify all the covariates included in each model, ideally within the table or its footnotes. This would improve transparency and reproducibility.</li><li><strong>Decile Analysis Limitations</strong>: While examining deciles allows for exploring trends, it might not be the most informative approach for identifying a potential threshold effect or optimal range for the plant-to-animal protein ratio. The authors should consider alternative analyses, such as using splines or categorizing the ratio based on clinically or biologically relevant cutoffs.</li><li><strong>Multiple Comparisons</strong>: The lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons could inflate the risk of type I error. While the authors acknowledge this limitation in the methods, they should consider applying a correction method (e.g., Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg) to the p-values to address this issue.</li></ul>

The use of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) allows for clear comparisons between deciles. The inclusion of a p-value for the trend further strengthens the presentation of the results.</li><li><strong>Reference Group Definition</strong>: While the table presents HRs for each decile, the reference group (Decile 1) is somewhat unclear. Explicitly stating the actual plant-to-animal protein ratio for Decile 1 (and ideally for all deciles) in the table would enhance clarity and interpretation.</li><li><strong>Model Description</strong>: The table could be improved by including a brief explanation of the multivariable models used in the analysis (Models 1-3) within the table or caption. This would help readers understand the adjustments made and interpret the HRs more accurately.</li><li><strong>Ratio Presentation</strong>: The presentation of the ratio in two formats (decimal and ratio) could be confusing. Maintaining consistency in presenting the ratio (e.g., only as a decimal or only as a ratio) would improve readability. In this case, it would be better to present it as a ratio to improve understanding.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Figure 2 illustrates the dose-response relationship between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of three cardiovascular outcomes: total cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke. Each panel (A, B, and C) represents a separate outcome. The x-axis represents the plant-to-animal protein ratio, and the y-axis represents the hazard ratio (HR) for each outcome. The solid lines depict the fitted dose-response curves generated using restricted cubic splines, a statistical method used to model non-linear relationships. The dotted lines represent the 95% confidence intervals around the HR estimates. P-values are provided for curvature (non-linearity) and linearity of the relationships. A plant-to-animal protein ratio means the energy you get from plant protein divided by the energy you get from animal protein. For example, if you get 10% of your energy from plant protein and 20% of your energy from animal protein, the plant-to-animal protein ratio is 10/20 = 0.5. The hazard ratio shows how much more or less likely someone is to have the event compared to people in the reference group (lowest protein ratio).</li><li><strong>Technical Terms</strong>: Restricted cubic splines are a flexible statistical method used to model non-linear relationships between variables. They involve dividing the range of the predictor variable (here, plant-to-animal protein ratio) into sections (knots) and fitting separate cubic polynomials within each section, ensuring smoothness at the knots. The hazard ratio (HR) is a measure of relative risk, indicating the likelihood of developing an event (like CVD, CAD, or stroke) in one group compared to another group (usually a reference group with the lowest exposure). A 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range within which we are 95% confident that the true HR lies.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Spline Methodology</strong>: Using restricted cubic splines is a valid approach for exploring and visualizing non-linear dose-response relationships. The authors appropriately provide p-values for linearity and curvature to assess the nature of the relationships. However, the choice of knots for the splines should be justified. Did the authors use pre-specified knots based on prior knowledge, or were they determined data-dependently?  Sensitivity analyses using different knot locations would strengthen the robustness of the findings.</li><li><strong>Cohort Heterogeneity</strong>: Pooling data from three cohorts increases statistical power. However, potential heterogeneity among cohorts could affect the dose-response relationship. Did the authors assess for interactions between the protein ratio and cohort membership? Stratified analyses or inclusion of interaction terms in the model would address potential heterogeneity and provide more nuanced results. Additionally, more details about the multivariable adjustments would help.</li><li><strong>Model Details and Validation</strong>: The caption mentions a multivariable model but lacks details on model selection, diagnostic checks, and assessment of model fit. Providing these details would enhance the transparency and rigor of the analysis. Specifically, what criteria were used for selecting the variables in the model? Were any interactions between covariates considered?</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Overall clarity and presentation</strong>: The figure clearly presents the dose-response relationships for the three cardiovascular outcomes. The use of separate panels for each outcome facilitates comparison and interpretation. The x and y axes are labeled clearly, and the caption provides sufficient context. The visual presentation of the splines, confidence intervals, and p-values for curvature and linearity effectively communicates the key findings.</li><li><strong>Highlighting Key Findings</strong>: While the figure effectively presents the trends, visually highlighting key points or areas of interest (e.g., points where the curves plateau or change direction) could enhance interpretation. Annotations or callouts on the graph could guide the reader&#x27;s attention to these important aspects of the dose-response relationship.</li><li><strong>Clarity of X-axis Units</strong>: The figure could benefit from a clearer explanation of the units used for the plant-to-animal protein ratio on the x-axis. While the caption mentions it is a ratio, providing example values or specifying if it&#x27;s based on protein intake in grams or percentage of total calories would enhance understanding.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Figure 3 presents the joint association of plant-to-animal protein ratio and protein density with cardiovascular outcomes (total CVD, coronary artery disease [CAD], and stroke). It shows how the combined effect of these two factors influences the risk of each outcome. The figure is divided into three panels, one for each outcome. Within each panel, the x-axis represents combinations of plant-to-animal protein ratio categories (lower, middle, higher) and protein density categories (lower, medium, higher). The y-axis represents the hazard ratio (HR), a measure of relative risk. Each bar represents a specific combination of protein ratio and density, with its height corresponding to the HR. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The reference group (lowest risk) is the combination of lower plant-to-animal protein ratio and lower protein density. A plant-to-animal protein ratio is the energy from plant protein divided by the energy from animal protein. Protein density refers to the percentage of total daily calories that come from protein.</li><li><strong>Statistical Measures</strong>: A hazard ratio (HR) represents the relative risk of experiencing the outcome in a specific group compared to the reference group. An HR less than 1 indicates a reduced risk, an HR greater than 1 indicates an increased risk, and an HR of 1 indicates no difference in risk. The 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values within which the true HR is likely to fall 95% of the time. If the CI doesn&#x27;t cross 1, the result is considered statistically significant.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Interaction Assessment</strong>: Investigating the joint effects of protein ratio and density is crucial for understanding their combined influence on cardiovascular risk. The use of Cox regression models is appropriate for analyzing time-to-event data. However, the authors should clearly state the interaction term used in the Cox model and report its p-value. This is essential for determining whether the combined effect is statistically significant and differs from the individual effects of protein ratio and density.</li><li><strong>Covariate Specification</strong>: The caption mentions adjusting for covariates from Model 3 in Table 2. However, it&#x27;s important to explicitly list these covariates in the figure caption or a supplementary table. This enhances transparency and allows for a better understanding of potential confounding factors considered.</li><li><strong>Multiple Comparisons</strong>: The figure caption notes that no corrections for multiple tests were applied. While this is acknowledged, the authors should explain their rationale for this decision. Given the multiple comparisons made in the figure, a correction method (e.g., Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg) should be considered to minimize the risk of false positives. The rationale for not applying a correction should be explicitly stated and justified.</li><li><strong>Ratio Categorization</strong>: The cutoff of &gt;0.50 for defining &quot;higher ratios&quot; needs justification. Is this cutoff based on prior research, clinical guidelines, or a data-driven approach? Providing a clear rationale for this categorization would strengthen the analysis.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Clarity of Presentation</strong>: The figure is generally clear in presenting the joint associations of protein ratio and density with cardiovascular outcomes. The use of different colors and groupings helps differentiate the combined categories. Displaying HRs with confidence intervals provides a clear comparison across the groups.</li><li><strong>Y-axis Label Specificity</strong>: The y-axis label &quot;Hazard Ratio (HR)&quot; could be improved by specifying the outcome to which the HR refers. Since there are three separate panels for different outcomes, adding the specific outcome (CVD, CAD, or Stroke) to each y-axis label would improve clarity.</li><li><strong>Visualizing Interaction</strong>: While the figure shows the joint effects, it doesn&#x27;t visually represent the interaction itself. Including a panel or separate figure demonstrating the interaction between protein ratio and density for each outcome would enhance understanding and highlight the interaction&#x27;s significance.</li><li><strong>Protein Density Values</strong>: Consider adding the exact protein density percentages for each category (low, medium, high) in the figure legend or labels.

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Association of P:A Ratio with CVD and CAD:</strong> The study found an inverse association between a higher plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary artery disease (CAD), but not stroke. Imagine your diet as a spectrum with plant protein on one end and animal protein on the other. This study suggests that shifting towards the plant protein end lowers the risk of heart problems like clogged arteries (CAD), but doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the risk of stroke (problems with blood flow to the brain).</li><li><strong>Nonlinear Dose-Response Relationship:</strong> The dose-response relationship for CVD and CAD was nonlinear, meaning the risk reduction was more pronounced at lower ratios and plateaued at higher ratios. Think of it like diminishing returns: the initial shift towards plant protein has the biggest impact, but the benefits level off as you continue to increase the ratio. For stroke, there was no clear dose-response relationship.</li><li><strong>Joint Effect of P:A Ratio and Protein Density:</strong> The protective effect against CVD and CAD was amplified when higher plant-to-animal protein ratios were combined with higher protein density (percentage of calories from protein). This suggests that both the *type* of protein and the *amount* you consume play a role in heart health. It&#x27;s like building a house: you need both the right materials (plant protein) and enough of them (protein density) for a strong foundation.</li><li><strong>Substitution Analyses and Beneficial Plant Protein Sources:</strong> Substitution analyses, which simulate replacing animal protein with plant protein, indicated that swapping red and processed meat with plant proteins, particularly nuts, yielded the greatest CVD/CAD benefit. This highlights the importance of not just increasing plant protein, but also choosing the right sources. It&#x27;s like upgrading your car&#x27;s engine: replacing old, inefficient parts (red meat) with newer, more efficient ones (nuts) leads to better performance.</li><li><strong>Robustness through Sensitivity Analyses:</strong> Sensitivity analyses using different dietary assessment methods and adjusting for various factors yielded consistent results, strengthening the study&#x27;s robustness. This is like testing a theory under different conditions to make sure it holds up. The consistent findings across various analyses increase confidence in the study&#x27;s conclusions.</li><li><strong>Potential Mechanisms:</strong> The study discusses the potential mechanisms underlying the observed associations, including differences in amino acid profiles, fiber content, saturated fat, and other nutrients. Plant protein tends to be lower in saturated fat and branched-chain amino acids (linked to higher CVD risk), and higher in fiber and arginine (potentially beneficial for blood pressure). Understanding these mechanisms can help refine dietary guidelines and identify potential targets for future research.</li><li><strong>Limitations:</strong> The study acknowledges limitations, including the reliance on self-reported dietary intake (which can be prone to errors), the exclusion of a substantial number of participants, and the potential for residual confounding. These limitations are important to consider when interpreting the findings and planning future research. Acknowledging limitations is a sign of scientific rigor and transparency.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Effective summary of key findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings, highlighting the inverse association between plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD/CAD risk, the null association with stroke, and the enhanced benefit with higher protein density. This concisely reiterates the key results for the reader.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In these 3 large prospective cohort studies, a higher plant-to-animal protein ratio (~0.76 compared with ~0.24) was associated with a 19% lower risk of CVD and a 27% lower risk of CAD but was not associated with stroke." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide specific dietary recommendations</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact improvement that would enhance the discussion&#x27;s contribution to dietary recommendations. While the discussion mentions the benefits of replacing animal protein with plant protein, it doesn&#x27;t provide specific, actionable dietary advice based on the findings. Translating the research into practical recommendations would increase the study&#x27;s impact on public health and clinical practice. Providing clear dietary advice would empower readers to make informed choices about their protein intake and potentially reduce their CVD risk. This would also enhance the translational value of the study and bridge the gap between research and practice. The discussion should include specific dietary recommendations based on the findings. For example, &quot;Based on our findings, we recommend that individuals aim for a plant-to-animal protein ratio of at least 0.5, prioritizing plant protein sources such as legumes, nuts, and whole grains over red and processed meat. For individuals at high risk of CAD, a higher ratio of 0.76 or greater may be beneficial.&quot;</p>
        <div class="quote">"There are several mechanisms in which a higher plant-to-animal protein ratio in the diet may be associated with lower CVD risk." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add specific dietary recommendations based on the study&#x27;s findings. For example, &quot;Based on our findings, we recommend that individuals aim for a plant-to-animal protein ratio of at least 0.5, prioritizing plant protein sources such as legumes, nuts, and whole grains over red and processed meat. For individuals at high risk of CAD, a higher ratio of 0.76 or greater may be beneficial.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on potential mechanisms</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact improvement that would enhance the discussion&#x27;s scientific rigor and contribution to the field. While the discussion mentions potential mechanisms, it lacks a thorough exploration of the biological pathways linking plant-to-animal protein ratio to CVD risk. Expanding on these mechanisms would strengthen the study&#x27;s scientific contribution and provide a deeper understanding of the observed associations. A more detailed discussion of the mechanisms would stimulate further research and potentially lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for CVD prevention. This would also enhance the reader&#x27;s understanding of the complex interplay between diet and CVD risk. The discussion should elaborate on the potential mechanisms linking plant-to-animal protein ratio to CVD risk. This could include discussing the role of amino acid profiles, fiber, saturated fat, and other nutrients in mediating the observed associations. For example, &quot;The observed inverse association between plant-to-animal protein ratio and CVD risk may be mediated by several factors, including the lower saturated fat and higher fiber content of plant-based diets, as well as differences in amino acid profiles. Plant proteins are typically lower in branched-chain amino acids, which have been linked to increased CVD risk, and higher in arginine, which may have beneficial effects on blood pressure.&quot;</p>
        <div class="quote">"There are several mechanisms in which a higher plant-to-animal protein ratio in the diet may be associated with lower CVD risk." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion of potential mechanisms linking plant-to-animal protein ratio to CVD risk. Include a detailed discussion of the role of amino acid profiles, fiber, saturated fat, and other nutrients in mediating the observed associations.</p>

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Figure 4 displays the results of subgroup analyses examining the association between a 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes (CVD, CAD, and stroke). The figure uses a forest plot format, where each row represents a different subgroup. The blue dots represent the pooled, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for each subgroup, and the black horizontal lines represent the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The vertical line at HR = 1 represents the null hypothesis (no association). If a CI crosses this line, the result is not statistically significant. P-values for interaction are provided for each subgroup, indicating whether the effect of the plant-to-animal protein ratio differs significantly across the subgroup categories. Plant-to-animal protein ratio is the energy you get from plant protein divided by the energy you get from animal protein. An increase of 1-SD in the plant-to-animal protein ratio represents a change in the ratio equal to one standard deviation of that ratio in the study population. A standard deviation represents how spread out the ratio is across the study population.</li><li><strong>Statistical Measures</strong>: A hazard ratio (HR) is a measure of relative risk, indicating the likelihood of developing the outcome in one group compared to another. A 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true HR lies. A p-value for interaction tests whether the effect of the plant-to-animal protein ratio is different across subgroups. A p-value less than 0.05 usually suggests that the interaction is statistically significant.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Subgroup Selection Rationale</strong>: Conducting subgroup analyses is essential for assessing the consistency of the main findings across different population characteristics. However, the choice of subgroups should be based on a priori hypotheses and justified based on biological or clinical plausibility. The authors should provide a clear rationale for the selected subgroups and explain why these specific factors were considered potential effect modifiers. Are the subgroups selected based on some pre-defined hypotheses or post hoc analysis?</li><li><strong>Handling of Subgroup Variables in the Model</strong>: The caption mentions using the same covariates as Model 3 in Table 2. However, it also states that the categorical covariate being investigated was not included in the model when used as a strata. This needs clarification. If the subgroup variable is part of the multivariable adjustment in the main analysis, it should be removed from the model when performing subgroup analysis for that specific variable to avoid over-adjustment. The authors should explicitly state how they handled this and ensure the analysis is performed correctly.</li><li><strong>Heterogeneity Across Cohorts Within Subgroups</strong>: The figure presents pooled HRs, which assumes no substantial heterogeneity among cohorts. However, the authors should explicitly state whether they tested for heterogeneity of effects across cohorts within each subgroup. If significant heterogeneity exists, presenting pooled estimates may not be appropriate, and stratified results should be presented or a random effects model used.</li><li><strong>Multiple Comparisons</strong>: The authors should address the issue of multiple comparisons. While they acknowledge that no corrections were applied, they need to discuss the implications of this decision and the potential for inflated type I error rates. Providing adjusted p-values, or at least discussing the potential impact of multiple comparisons on the interpretation of results, would strengthen the analysis.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear Visual Representation</strong>: The forest plot effectively visualizes the results of the subgroup analyses, making it easy to compare the effects of a 1-SD increase in plant-to-animal protein ratio across different subgroups. The consistent use of blue dots for HRs and black lines for CIs facilitates quick interpretation. The inclusion of p-values for interaction directly on the plot enhances understanding of the significance of subgroup differences.</li><li><strong>Direction of Interaction</strong>: While the figure presents p-values for interaction, clarifying the direction of these interactions would be beneficial. For instance, indicating whether the association is stronger or weaker in specific subgroups (e.g., using annotations or different colors) would enhance interpretation.</li><li><strong>Subgroup Ordering</strong>: Consider reordering the subgroups based on the magnitude or significance of the interaction effect. This would help highlight the most relevant findings and improve the visual flow of information.</li><li><strong>Defining Median Cut-offs</strong>: The figure caption should clearly define what constitutes &quot;below&quot; and &quot;above median&quot; for continuous variables like physical activity, BMI, age, and AHEI. Providing these cut-off values directly in the caption would enhance interpretation.</li></ul>

HR (95% CI) for each cardiovascular outcome associated with replacing 3% energy from animal protein with plant protein and 1 daily serving of poultry, red meat, and dairy replaced with refined grains and potatoes, whole grains, nuts, and legumes are shown.

        <li><strong>Content and Organization</strong>: Figure 5 presents the results of substitution analyses, which estimate the change in cardiovascular disease risk associated with replacing specific animal protein sources with plant protein sources. It shows two types of substitutions: 1) Replacing 3% of total energy from animal protein with plant protein (isocaloric substitution); 2) Replacing one serving per day of a specific animal protein food (poultry, red meat, or dairy) with a serving of a plant protein food (refined grains and potatoes, whole grains, nuts, or legumes). The results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each substitution and outcome (CVD, CAD, and stroke). A plant-to-animal protein ratio is the energy from plant protein divided by the energy from animal protein. An isocaloric substitution means that the same number of calories are maintained when the proteins are substituted.</li><li><strong>Statistical Measures and Methods</strong>: A hazard ratio (HR) less than 1 indicates a reduced risk of the outcome when the substitution is made, while an HR greater than 1 indicates an increased risk. The 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range of plausible values for the true HR. A leave-one-out analysis is a statistical method used in substitution analysis where one food item is removed, and another is added to the diet, while keeping total energy intake constant. β-coefficients (beta coefficients) are values from a statistical model (here, Cox proportional hazards model) representing the association between a predictor variable (food item) and the outcome. Exponentiating the difference between β-coefficients provides the HR for the substitution. Variances and covariances are measures of statistical variability and association, respectively, used to calculate the CI of the HR.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Isocaloric Substitution</strong>: Substitution analyses are valuable for assessing the potential impact of dietary changes on health outcomes. However, it&#x27;s crucial that these analyses maintain isocaloric conditions to accurately estimate the effects of replacing one food with another. The authors should carefully consider the potential impact of residual energy and ensure that the substitutions are truly isocaloric, especially when using servings/d which don&#x27;t perfectly account for energy differences between foods.</li><li><strong>Justification for Substitution Amounts</strong>: The choice of 3% energy replacement and one serving/d substitutions should be justified. Are these values based on realistic dietary changes or existing dietary guidelines?  Providing a rationale for these specific amounts would strengthen the validity and relevance of the findings.</li><li><strong>Confounding Assessment</strong>: The caption mentions numerous covariates included in the Cox proportional hazards model. However, it&#x27;s important to justify the inclusion of each covariate and explain how potential confounding was addressed. Were there any covariates strongly correlated with both protein intake and cardiovascular outcomes?  Providing a clear description of the confounding assessment and control would strengthen the analysis.</li><li><strong>Multiple Comparisons</strong>: The authors acknowledge that no corrections for multiple comparisons were applied. Given the numerous substitutions and outcomes examined, there is a high risk of type I error. The authors should consider adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons or at least discuss the implications of not doing so.</li><li><strong>Selection of Top Animal Protein Sources</strong>: The caption provides limited information about the &quot;top animal protein sources.&quot; Specifying the criteria used for selecting these top sources (e.g., most commonly consumed, highest contribution to total animal protein intake) would enhance transparency.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Overall Clarity and Organization</strong>: The figure effectively communicates the results of the substitution analyses. The use of a forest plot format with colored dots for HRs and horizontal lines for CIs allows for clear comparison of the effects of different substitutions. The arrangement of substitutions by animal protein source (poultry, red meat, dairy) improves clarity and facilitates interpretation.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Substitution Analysis</strong>: While the figure caption provides a detailed description of the statistical methods, it could benefit from a concise explanation of what a substitution analysis entails. A brief explanation in the caption or a separate note could clarify the purpose and interpretation of these analyses for a broader audience.</li><li><strong>Visual Grouping of Results</strong>: Visually separating or grouping the results for the 3% energy replacement and the individual food substitutions would enhance clarity and make it easier to distinguish between these two types of analyses.</li><li><strong>Reference Line for Null Hypothesis</strong>: Consider adding a reference line at HR=1 to visually emphasize the null hypothesis and facilitate the quick identification of statistically significant results.</li></ul>
