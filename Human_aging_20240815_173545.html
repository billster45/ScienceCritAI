            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>This research paper investigates the nonlinear dynamics of multi-omics profiles during human aging. The study involved a longitudinal cohort of 108 participants aged between 25 and 75 years, residing in California, USA. Participants were tracked for a median period of 1.7 years, with a maximum follow-up duration of 6.8 years. Comprehensive multi-omics profiling was performed, revealing consistent nonlinear patterns in molecular markers of aging. Two major periods of substantial dysregulation were identified, occurring at approximately 44 years and 60 years of age. Distinct molecules and functional pathways associated with these periods were identified, including immune regulation and carbohydrate metabolism changes at the 60-year transition and cardiovascular disease, lipid and alcohol metabolism changes at the 40-year transition. The research concludes that functions and risks of aging-related diseases change nonlinearly across the human lifespan and provides insights into the molecular and biological pathways involved in these changes.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>This section presents the results of the study, starting with a description of the cohort and the multi-omics data collected. The authors highlight the nonlinear nature of molecular changes during aging, revealing that only a small portion of molecules exhibit linear changes. They employ clustering analysis to group molecules with similar trajectories, identifying three distinct clusters with clear nonlinear patterns. The authors then perform functional analysis on these clusters, uncovering pathways and modules associated with GTPase activity, histone modification, oxidative stress, mRNA stability, autophagy, and disease risks such as cardiovascular disease, kidney issues, and type 2 diabetes. They further investigate the dynamics of aging-related molecular changes using a modified DE-SWAN algorithm, identifying two prominent crests of dysregulation around the ages of 45 and 65. Functional analysis of these crests reveals modules related to CVD, skin and muscle stability, lipid and alcohol metabolism, immune dysfunction, kidney function, and carbohydrate metabolism. The authors emphasize the complementary nature of the two approaches (trajectory clustering and DE-SWAN) in capturing the nonlinear changes in molecules and functions during human aging.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis Of Presented Data:</strong> The figure effectively presents the results of the DE-SWAN analysis, showing the presence of two prominent crests of dysregulation around the ages of 44 and 60. The robustness checks in panels (b) and (c) demonstrate that the wave pattern is consistent across different q-value cutoffs and window sizes for data smoothing. The panel of line graphs in panel (d) shows that the crests are consistently found in several omics datasets, particularly in proteomics, metabolomics, and some microbiome data.</p><p><strong>Statistical Methods:</strong> The authors use a modified DE-SWAN algorithm to identify waves of dysregulated molecules and microbes across the human lifespan. This method is appropriate for detecting age-related changes that occur at specific time points without exhibiting a consistent pattern in other stages. The authors perform robustness checks using different q-value cutoffs and window sizes, which strengthens the reliability of the findings. However, the authors do not provide details about the statistical test used within the DE-SWAN algorithm or the criteria for selecting significant molecules/microbes.</p><p><strong>Assumptions And Limitations:</strong> The analysis assumes that the 20-year window and 10-year parcel sizes used in the DE-SWAN algorithm are optimal for capturing the age-related changes. However, other window and parcel sizes may be more appropriate for different data types or biological processes. Additionally, the analysis assumes that the observed changes in molecule/microbe levels are primarily driven by age and not by other confounding factors. The authors acknowledge this limitation and perform additional analyses to explore the potential impact of confounders, but residual confounding may still be present.</p><p><strong>Improvements And Alternatives:</strong> The authors could provide more details about the statistical test used within the DE-SWAN algorithm and the criteria for selecting significant molecules/microbes. They could also explore the use of alternative window and parcel sizes to assess the sensitivity of the results to these parameters. Additionally, they could consider using statistical methods that explicitly account for potential confounders, such as multivariable regression or propensity score matching.</p><p><strong>Consistency And Comparisons:</strong> The findings presented in Figure 4 are consistent with the text in the Results section, further supporting the authors&#x27; central argument that aging is characterized by nonlinear molecular alterations.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The discussion section delves into the implications of the study&#x27;s findings, emphasizing the nonlinear nature of molecular changes during aging. The authors highlight that only a small portion of molecules exhibit linear changes, reinforcing the limitations of relying solely on linear models to understand aging. They discuss the three distinct clusters identified through trajectory clustering, pointing out specific age ranges where substantial molecular alterations occur, particularly around 60 years old. The functional analysis of these clusters is discussed, linking them to biological processes like oxidative stress, mRNA stability, autophagy, and disease risks such as cardiovascular disease, kidney issues, and type 2 diabetes. The authors further discuss the two prominent crests of dysregulation identified using the DE-SWAN algorithm, occurring around the ages of 40 and 60. They emphasize the consistency of these crests across various omics data types, suggesting their universal nature in the aging process. The functional analysis of these crests is also discussed, revealing modules associated with cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle stability, lipid and alcohol metabolism, immune dysfunction, kidney function, and carbohydrate metabolism. The authors acknowledge the study&#x27;s limitations, including the modest cohort size, potential confounders related to lifestyle factors, and the focus on blood-based molecular data. They suggest future research directions, including expanding the cohort size, incorporating more diverse populations, collecting longitudinal data over longer periods, and investigating the relationship between nonlinear molecular patterns and functional capacities, disease occurrences, and mortality hazards.</p>
