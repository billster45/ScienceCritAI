            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This abstract introduces a study evaluating OpenAI&#39;s o1, a large language model with internalized chain-of-thought, in the medical field. It focuses on o1&#39;s understanding, reasoning, and multilingual capabilities across 37 medical datasets, including new question-answering tasks based on professional medical quizzes. The study finds that o1 shows promise in medical applications, outperforming GPT-4, but also identifies weaknesses like hallucination and inconsistent multilingual abilities.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To evaluate the performance of o1 in the medical domain, focusing on understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality.</li><li><strong>Datasets:</strong> 37 medical datasets were used, including two new QA datasets based on quizzes from NEJM and The Lancet.</li><li><strong>Findings:</strong> o1 demonstrates improved clinical understanding and reasoning, outperforming GPT-4, but still exhibits weaknesses such as hallucination and inconsistent multilingual ability.</li><li><strong>Methodology:</strong> The study evaluated o1 across six tasks using diverse prompting strategies, including direct prompting, chain-of-thought, and few-shot prompting.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear research focus</strong>
        <p>The abstract clearly states the purpose of the research, which is to evaluate the performance of o1 in the medical domain.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To this end, this report provides a preliminary exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, comprehensively examining 3 key aspects: understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Relevance of datasets</strong>
        <p>The use of datasets based on professional medical quizzes (NEJM and The Lancet) adds clinical relevance and real-world applicability to the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"including two newly constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify improvements</strong>
        <p>While the abstract mentions that o1 surpasses GPT-4, it would be stronger to quantify this improvement with specific percentages or metrics.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy" (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying the improvement would provide a more concrete measure of o1&#39;s performance gain and strengthen the impact of the findings.</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on weaknesses</strong>
        <p>The abstract briefly mentions weaknesses like hallucination and inconsistent multilingual ability. Providing more detail on these limitations would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"But meanwhile, we also identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of the weaknesses would provide a more balanced perspective on o1&#39;s performance and highlight areas for future research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly describe the types of hallucinations observed and the specific contexts where multilingual ability is inconsistent.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for a study evaluating the OpenAI o1 model&#39;s performance in medicine. It discusses the concept of general intelligence, the progress of LLMs, and the limitations of current medical LLM benchmarks. The paper aims to address this gap by evaluating o1&#39;s understanding, reasoning, and multilingual capabilities in medicine using existing and newly created datasets.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>General Intelligence:</strong> The introduction highlights the ongoing pursuit of artificial general intelligence and how LLMs represent significant progress in this area.</li><li><strong>LLM Advancements:</strong> It traces the evolution of LLMs, emphasizing the role of prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) and OpenAI&#39;s integration of CoT into o1&#39;s training.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Current Benchmarks:</strong> It critiques existing medical LLM benchmarks for their narrow focus and lack of comprehensive assessment, particularly for advanced models like o1.</li><li><strong>Research Gap and Aim:</strong> The paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive evaluation of o1&#39;s capabilities in medicine, focusing on understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality.</li><li><strong>Evaluation Approach:</strong> The study uses 35 existing medical datasets and develops two new QA datasets to evaluate o1 across these three key aspects.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Contextual Background</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context by discussing the broader field of AI and the evolution of LLMs, leading to the rationale for evaluating o1 in medicine.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The most exciting progresses in AI are achieved by language models in these years, from the initial start of ChatGPT to its evolution and other open-source projects (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Problem Statement</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly articulates the limitations of current medical LLM benchmarks and the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of advanced models like o1.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Moreover, current benchmarks for LLMs in the medical domain often evaluate models only on a limited set of factors, often focusing on isolated aspects such as knowledge and reasoning (Nori et al., 2023b; Li´evin et al., 2024), safety (Han et al., 2024), or multilinguality (Wang et al., 2024)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on o1&#39;s Novelty</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions o1&#39;s internalized CoT, it could further elaborate on what makes o1 unique compared to previous models and how this might impact its performance in medicine.</p>
        <div class="quote">"OpenAI capitalized on this by embedding the CoT process into model training, integrating reinforcement learning, and finally introduced the o1 model (OpenAI, 2024)." (Page 2)</div>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section analyzes the implications of o1&#39;s performance in the medical domain, highlighting both its potential benefits and drawbacks. It raises concerns about o1&#39;s adverse impacts, such as increased decoding time and inconsistent performance across tasks. The section also emphasizes the need for rethinking evaluation metrics for stronger LLMs, advocating for more robust measures beyond traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. Finally, it calls for more reliable prompting techniques adapted to the evolving internal prompting strategies of future LLMs.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Adverse Impacts of o1:</strong> Discusses the increased decoding time and inconsistent performance of o1 compared to previous models.</li><li><strong>Rethinking Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Critiques traditional metrics and highlights the need for more robust evaluation methods for advanced LLMs.</li><li><strong>Reliable Prompting Techniques:</strong> Advocates for developing prompting techniques that are adaptable to future LLMs with internal prompting strategies.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Critical Analysis of o1</strong>
        <p>The section goes beyond simply praising o1&#39;s performance and critically examines its limitations and potential drawbacks, such as increased decoding time and inconsistent performance across tasks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Additionally, o1 does not always outperform other models, with inconsistent performance across different tasks." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Addressing Evaluation Challenges</strong>
        <p>The section raises important questions about the limitations of current evaluation metrics for advanced LLMs and advocates for the development of more robust measures.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which rely on n-gram overlap, have long been criticized for their limitations in capturing the quality of generated text, particularly for LLMs." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>More Specific Examples</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions o1&#39;s inconsistent performance, it would be stronger with more specific examples and analysis of when and why o1 underperforms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For instance, in the concept recognition task detailed in Table 2, o1 underperforms compared to other LLMs on half of the datasets." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing specific examples would make the analysis more concrete and persuasive, allowing readers to better understand the limitations of o1.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Select a few representative examples of datasets or tasks where o1 underperforms and provide a detailed analysis of the possible reasons for this underperformance. Consider factors such as task complexity, data characteristics, or limitations of the model&#39;s architecture or training data.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Metrics</strong>
        <p>The section critiques traditional metrics but could benefit from exploring and suggesting specific alternative metrics that might be more suitable for evaluating advanced LLMs.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Therefore, there is a growing need to develop more robust and nuanced evaluation metrics that can better assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in complex scenarios." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Suggesting concrete alternative metrics would provide more actionable guidance for future research and contribute to the development of better evaluation practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss specific alternative metrics that have been proposed in the literature, such as metrics based on semantic similarity, factual consistency, or human evaluation. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives and discuss their potential applicability to evaluating medical LLMs like o1.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Prompting Techniques</strong>
        <p>The section briefly mentions the need for reliable prompting techniques but could expand on this by discussing specific strategies and their potential benefits for future LLMs.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As future LLMs like o1 may continue to evolve with internal prompts for efficient user instruction, new prompting methods should consider their adaptability to existing strategies." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of prompting techniques would provide valuable insights for future research and development of LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss specific prompting strategies that could be adapted to future LLMs with internal prompts. Consider techniques like prompt engineering, meta-learning for prompt generation, or incorporating external knowledge into prompts. Analyze the potential benefits and limitations of these strategies in the context of medical applications.</p>
