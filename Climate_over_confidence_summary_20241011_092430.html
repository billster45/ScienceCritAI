        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This study examines the risks and implications of &quot;overshoot pathways,&quot; where global temperatures temporarily exceed the Paris Agreement&#39;s warming limits before being brought back down. The authors argue that overshoot scenarios present significantly different and often irreversible climate risks compared to pathways that avoid exceeding the limits. Using various climate models and scenarios, they demonstrate that achieving declining temperatures after an overshoot is crucial for limiting long-term risks but also highlight the substantial uncertainties involved in temperature reversal, particularly concerning the effectiveness and feasibility of large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The study emphasizes the need for rapid near-term emission reductions to minimize reliance on CDR and mitigate climate risks effectively.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate Response Uncertainty and CDR Needs:</strong> The amount of CDR required to reverse warming after an overshoot is highly uncertain and depends on the climate&#39;s sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions. Using the FaIR model, the study demonstrates that some scenarios may require hundreds of gigatonnes of CO2 removal, exceeding current technological capabilities and raising feasibility concerns. This implies that we need to plan for a range of possible warming outcomes, not just the most likely one, to adequately prepare for and mitigate the risks of overshoot.</li><li><strong>Regional Climate Change Irreversibility:</strong> Even if global temperatures decline after an overshoot, regional climates may not simply revert to their previous states. Model simulations reveal persistent regional differences in temperature and precipitation patterns between overshoot and stabilization scenarios, particularly in the North Atlantic and adjacent European regions, due to the time-lagged response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This implies that regional impacts can be more severe and long-lasting than predicted by global averages, requiring region-specific adaptation strategies.</li><li><strong>Irreversible Impacts Across Earth Systems:</strong> Certain climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, changes in the deep ocean, and shifts in ecosystems, are not readily reversible, even with declining global temperatures. Sea levels, in particular, are projected to continue rising for centuries to millennia due to thermal expansion and ice sheet melt, posing significant long-term threats to coastal communities. This implies that some consequences of overshoot are locked in for generations, highlighting the need to avoid exceeding temperature limits in the first place.</li><li><strong>Socioeconomic Impacts and Adaptive Capacity:</strong> The severity of overshoot impacts depends heavily on the adaptive capacity of human systems. Low adaptive capacity, particularly in the near term and in low-income countries, can amplify climate risks, leading to lasting negative consequences for human well-being, economic performance, and intergenerational equity. This implies that prioritizing adaptation measures and enhancing resilience, especially for vulnerable populations, is essential for mitigating the societal and economic burdens of overshoot.</li><li><strong>Adaptation Planning Challenges:</strong> The long timescales involved in potential impact reversals (decades to centuries) often exceed the typical planning horizons of adaptation strategies and infrastructure lifecycles. This makes it challenging to incorporate the potential benefits of long-term temperature decline into near-term adaptation decisions. This implies that current adaptation planning should primarily focus on managing the risks associated with peak warming, rather than relying on uncertain future reversals.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Risk Assessment:</strong> The study considers a wide range of climate risks associated with overshoot, including biophysical, socioeconomic, and regional impacts. This holistic approach provides a more complete picture of the potential consequences of exceeding temperature limits.</li><li><strong>Use of Multiple Models and Scenarios:</strong> The study employs various climate models and emission scenarios, including the FaIR model, ESMs like GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM2-LM, and CMIP6 projections. This multi-model approach enhances the robustness of the findings and accounts for uncertainties in climate projections.</li><li><strong>Emphasis on Uncertainty:</strong> The study explicitly addresses the uncertainties inherent in climate projections and CDR deployment. This transparent handling of uncertainty strengthens the credibility of the analysis and highlights the need for caution in interpreting the results.</li><li><strong>Clear Ethical Focus:</strong> The study clearly articulates the ethical implications of overshoot, particularly concerning intergenerational equity and the disproportionate burden on vulnerable populations. This ethical focus adds an important dimension to the discussion and underscores the social justice aspects of climate change.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantifying Irreversible Impacts:</strong> While the study identifies numerous irreversible impacts, providing more quantitative estimates of their magnitude and duration would strengthen the analysis. Future research could focus on developing metrics and methods for quantifying irreversible changes across different Earth systems.</li><li><strong>Exploring Alternative Pathways:</strong> The study primarily focuses on a limited set of emission scenarios. Expanding the analysis to include a wider range of pathways, including those with more ambitious near-term emission reductions, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of overshoot risks and adaptation needs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significant Elements</h3>
        
    <div>
        <h4>Figure 2</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This figure visually demonstrates the uncertainty in CDR requirements for achieving temperature reversal. It shows the range of potential warming outcomes for a given emission pathway and estimates the cumulative CDR needed to return to 1.5°C by 2100 under different scenarios. The figure highlights the potential for high warming outcomes and the corresponding need for large-scale CDR deployment, emphasizing the importance of considering uncertainty in CDR planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 2 effectively communicates the central message about the uncertainty and potential scale of CDR required for temperature reversal. It visually reinforces the key finding that relying on median warming outcomes can lead to underestimating the CDR needs and the risks associated with overshoot.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h4>Figure 3</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This figure illustrates the regional differences in climate change between overshoot and stabilization scenarios. It compares regional temperature changes in two different climate models and shows that even after global temperatures stabilize, regional climates can differ significantly depending on whether an overshoot occurred. The figure emphasizes the complexity of regional climate change and the limitations of relying solely on global average temperature changes for predicting regional impacts.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 3 visually demonstrates the key finding that regional climate change is complex and cannot be accurately predicted based on global mean temperature changes alone, especially after an overshoot. It highlights the need for region-specific adaptation strategies and underscores the importance of considering regional impacts in climate risk assessments.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study provides compelling evidence that overshoot pathways present distinct and often irreversible climate risks compared to scenarios that avoid exceeding temperature limits. The uncertainty surrounding temperature reversal, the potentially massive scale of CDR required, and the lasting regional and socioeconomic impacts underscore the need for a precautionary approach to climate policy. Future research should focus on quantifying irreversible impacts, exploring alternative emission pathways, and developing robust adaptation strategies that account for the long-term consequences of overshoot. Critically, the study highlights the ethical imperative to minimize climate risks and prioritize rapid, deep emission reductions to avoid exceeding temperature limits in the first place, rather than relying on uncertain and potentially infeasible technological solutions to reverse warming after an overshoot.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The introduction sets the stage by explaining the context of insufficient global emission reduction efforts to meet the Paris Agreement&#39;s temperature goals. It highlights the increasing importance of exploring &quot;overshoot pathways,&quot; which involve temporarily exceeding the warming limit before bringing temperatures back down. The authors argue that climate change and associated risks after an overshoot differ significantly from a world that avoids it, emphasizing that achieving declining temperatures is crucial for limiting long-term risks. However, they caution against overconfidence in the feasibility and desirability of overshoot, highlighting uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and the limitations of carbon dioxide removal technologies. The introduction concludes by stressing the need for rapid near-term emission reductions to mitigate climate risks effectively.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Climate Overshoot Context:</strong> The introduction establishes the context of climate overshoot, arising from the inadequacy of current emission reduction efforts. This sets the stage for the paper&#39;s central argument about the risks and uncertainties associated with overshoot pathways.</li><li><strong>Importance of Declining Temperatures:</strong> The authors emphasize that achieving declining global temperatures, rather than just stabilization, is essential for mitigating long-term climate risks, particularly for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes.</li><li><strong>Uncertainties and Limitations:</strong> The introduction highlights the uncertainties surrounding temperature reversal, including the potential for strong Earth-system feedbacks and the limitations of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. This underscores the need for caution against overconfidence in overshoot scenarios.</li><li><strong>Focus on Near-Term Reductions:</strong> The introduction concludes by advocating for rapid near-term emission reductions as the most effective way to reduce climate risks, regardless of the long-term temperature trajectory.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Context Setting</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context of climate overshoot and its relevance to the Paris Agreement. It clearly explains why exploring overshoot pathways has become necessary due to insufficient emission reductions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2–5." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concise Summary of Key Findings</strong>
        <p>The introduction provides a concise summary of the paper&#39;s key findings, including the differences between overshoot and non-overshoot scenarios and the importance of declining temperatures. This helps readers quickly grasp the main takeaways of the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Uncertainty and Limitations</strong>
        <p>The introduction acknowledges the uncertainties and limitations associated with overshoot pathways, including the potential for Earth system feedbacks and the scalability of CDR. This strengthens the paper&#39;s credibility by presenting a balanced perspective.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>

    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Specific Regional Risks</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions regional differences, it could briefly elaborate on specific regional risks associated with overshoot. This would provide a more concrete understanding of the potential consequences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing specific regional examples would make the risks of overshoot more tangible and relatable for readers.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a brief sentence or two mentioning specific regions and the types of risks they might face, such as increased heatwaves in certain areas or changes in precipitation patterns in others.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Intended Audience</strong>
        <p>The introduction could more explicitly define the intended audience for the paper. This would help tailor the language and level of detail to the specific readership.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Clarifying the intended audience ensures that the paper effectively communicates its message to the relevant stakeholders.</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Hook</strong>
        <p>While the introduction provides context, it could benefit from a stronger hook to immediately engage the reader. This could be achieved by starting with a more compelling statement or question.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A stronger hook would capture the reader&#39;s attention and motivate them to continue reading.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Consider starting with a striking statistic about the likelihood of overshoot or a provocative question about the long-term consequences of exceeding the temperature limit.</p>

            <h3>Conceptual categories of peak and decline emission pathways</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section introduces a new framework for categorizing emission pathways based on their peak temperature and subsequent decline characteristics. It argues that the existing categorization, primarily based on peak temperature outcomes, is insufficient for understanding the nuances of pathways aligned with the Paris Agreement. The proposed framework distinguishes between three pathway categories: Peak and Decline (PD), Overshoot (PD-OS), and Enhanced Protection (PD-EP) pathways. Each category is defined by its temperature trajectory and corresponding emission reduction strategies, emphasizing the importance of considering both peak warming and the rate and duration of temperature decline.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Peak and Decline (PD) Pathways:</strong> These pathways aim for a temperature peak followed by a sustained decline over several decades. They involve emission reductions in all greenhouse gases and require net-negative CO2 emissions after reaching net-zero.</li><li><strong>Overshoot (PD-OS) Pathways:</strong> A subset of PD pathways, these allow for exceeding a target warming level (e.g., 1.5°C) in the near term with the expectation of reversing warming later. The rate of emission reduction and the amount of net-negative emissions depend on the characteristics of the overshoot.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Protection (PD-EP) Pathways:</strong> These pathways prioritize minimizing peak warming and promoting a gradual temperature reversal to reduce climate risks. They involve stringent and rapid emission reductions, aiming for net-zero CO2 emissions as soon as possible and sustainable net-negative CO2 emissions thereafter.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Framework</strong>
        <p>The section presents a clear and well-defined framework for categorizing emission pathways based on peak and decline characteristics. This provides a more nuanced understanding of different pathway types and their implications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Because a peak and gradual reversal of global warming turns out to be a fundamental feature of Paris-compatible pathways16, we propose to henceforth categorize pathways in terms of their peak and decline characteristics (Table 1)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Relevance to Paris Agreement</strong>
        <p>The section explicitly links the proposed framework to the Paris Agreement, highlighting its importance for understanding and achieving the agreement&#39;s temperature goals.</p>
        <div class="quote">"PD pathways establish a target warming level to be achieved at some point in the far future but allow it to be exceeded with high likelihood over the near term in the conviction that warming can be reversed again at a later stage." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Context on Table 1</strong>
        <p>While Table 1 is referenced, the section could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the table&#39;s content and how it illustrates the proposed framework. This would improve the clarity and accessibility of the information.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Peak and decline pathways are differentiated by the stringency of emission reduction efforts in the near term and up to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, and the assumed net-negative CO2 emissions in the long term16." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more thorough explanation of Table 1 would help readers better understand the specific characteristics of each pathway category and how they differ in terms of temperature and emission trajectories.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion of Table 1 by providing more details on the specific temperature and emission characteristics of each pathway category, perhaps with illustrative examples or comparisons.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Limitations of the Framework</strong>
        <p>While the proposed framework is valuable, it&#39;s important to acknowledge its limitations. This would enhance the section&#39;s objectivity and provide a more balanced perspective.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging limitations strengthens the analysis and provides opportunities for future research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief discussion of the potential limitations of the framework, such as the challenges of accurately projecting long-term temperature decline or the uncertainties associated with achieving net-negative emissions.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            
    <h4>Non-Text Elements</h4>
    
    <details class="non-text-element">
        <summary>table 1</summary>
        <p>Table 1 categorizes peak and decline emission pathways based on temperature and emission characteristics. It distinguishes between three pathway categories: PD (peak and decline), PD-OS (overshoot), and PD-EP (enhanced protection). Each category is described in terms of its temperature trajectory (peak, decline, stabilization) and the corresponding emission reduction strategies (net-zero CO2, net-negative CO2, timing and stringency of reductions). Think of it like different routes to reach a destination: some routes might be faster but require sharper turns (rapid emission reductions), while others are slower but smoother (gradual reductions).</p>
        
        <div class="first-mention">
            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "categorize pathways in terms of their peak and decline characteristics (Table 1)."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Global GHG emission pathways have a central role in informing the development of policy benchmarks in line with the Paris Agreement and are a core part of climate change assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)2,15. These assessments categorize pathways principally based on their peak temperature outcome2,15. Because a peak and gradual reversal of global warming turns out to be a fundamental feature of Paris-compatible pathways16, we propose to henceforth categorize pathways in terms of their peak and decline characteristics (Table 1).</p>

            <h3>Uncertain climate response and reversal</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores the uncertainties associated with predicting how the climate will respond to emission changes, particularly in overshoot scenarios. It emphasizes that simply focusing on the median, or most likely, warming outcome can lead to underestimating the potential risks and the amount of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) needed to bring temperatures back down. The section uses a model to illustrate how different levels of climate sensitivity could result in significantly different warming outcomes, even with the same emission pathway. It also highlights the uncertainty in how much CDR would be required to return to 1.5°C warming by 2100, showing that hundreds of gigatonnes of CO2 removal might be necessary in some scenarios. Essentially, the section argues that we need to consider the full range of possible warming outcomes, not just the most likely one, to adequately plan for and mitigate the risks of overshoot.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Uncertainty in Climate Response:</strong> The section highlights the importance of considering uncertainties in climate response, including both the warming phase and the long-term state of the climate system after emissions peak. This uncertainty arises from factors like the strength of feedback loops and the effectiveness of CDR.</li><li><strong>Net-Negative CO2 Emissions (NNCE) Requirements:</strong> The section explores the NNCE requirements for an illustrative pathway that achieves net-zero CO2 emissions around mid-century and limits median peak warming close to 1.5°C. It finds that the required NNCE can vary significantly depending on the climate response, with some scenarios requiring large-scale CDR deployment.</li><li><strong>Climate Response Uncertainty Distribution:</strong> The analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution for climate response uncertainty, meaning that high warming outcomes are more likely than previously thought. This has significant implications for NNCE requirements and the feasibility of achieving temperature reversal.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Median Warming Focus:</strong> The section criticizes the common practice of focusing on median warming outcomes, arguing that this can lead to underestimation of potential risks and CDR needs. It emphasizes the importance of considering the full range of plausible warming outcomes.</li><li><strong>Need for Comprehensive Risk Assessment:</strong> The section concludes that a narrow focus on scenario uncertainty and median warming is insufficient for assessing potential CDR deployment requirements and that a comprehensive risk assessment considering the full range of uncertainties is essential.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of Uncertainty</strong>
        <p>The section effectively explains the concept of climate response uncertainty and its implications for overshoot scenarios. It uses clear language and avoids technical jargon, making the information accessible to a broader audience.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, to comprehensively assess overshoot risks and NNCE requirements for warming reversal, uncertainties in the climate response must also be considered." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Illustrative Example with FaIR Model</strong>
        <p>The use of the FaIR model provides a concrete example of how climate response uncertainty can affect warming outcomes and NNCE requirements. This helps readers visualize the potential range of outcomes and understand the importance of considering uncertainty.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We use 2,237 ensemble members of the simple carbon cycle and climate model Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) v.1.6.2 to estimate the range of physically plausible warming outcomes for this pathway, consistent with the uncertainty assessment of IPCC AR6 (Fig. 2a and Methods)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on High-Risk Futures</strong>
        <p>The section explicitly addresses high-risk futures where warming exceeds 1.5°C even after achieving net-zero CO2 emissions. This highlights the potential for severe consequences and the need for proactive measures to mitigate these risks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We also identify relatively high-risk futures in which warming exceeds 1.5°C at the time of net-zero CO2 and continues beyond (Fig. 2b, top right)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Regional Variations in Uncertainty</strong>
        <p>While the section focuses on global warming outcomes, it could briefly discuss how climate response uncertainty might vary across different regions. This would provide a more complete picture of the potential risks and challenges.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Regional variations in climate response uncertainty can have significant implications for adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing how climate sensitivity and other factors might differ across regions and how this could affect warming outcomes and CDR needs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Emission Pathways</strong>
        <p>The analysis focuses on a single illustrative emission pathway. Exploring alternative pathways with different emission reduction timelines and levels could provide a more comprehensive understanding of NNCE requirements and the feasibility of temperature reversal.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Considering different emission pathways would strengthen the analysis and provide more robust insights into the challenges of achieving the Paris Agreement goals.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Extend the analysis to include a range of emission pathways, perhaps using existing scenarios from the IPCC or other sources, and compare the NNCE requirements and warming outcomes across these pathways.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Limitations of the FaIR Model</strong>
        <p>While the FaIR model is useful for illustrating the concept of uncertainty, it&#39;s important to acknowledge its limitations. This would enhance the section&#39;s credibility and provide a more balanced perspective.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> All models have limitations, and acknowledging these limitations is crucial for interpreting the results accurately.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a brief discussion of the limitations of the FaIR model, such as its simplified representation of Earth system processes or its reliance on certain assumptions about climate sensitivity.</p>

        <summary>figure 2</summary>
        <p>Figure 2 estimates the cumulative net-negative CO2 emissions (NNCE) needed to achieve specific temperature targets, considering uncertainties in climate response. Panel (a) shows the net CO2 emissions pathway and the range of possible warming outcomes. Think of climate response uncertainty like predicting the temperature of a pot of water on a stove: you know the heat setting (emissions), but the actual temperature depends on factors like the pot&#39;s material and the amount of water. Panel (b) compares warming at the time of net-zero CO2 (around 2060) with the change in temperature between 2060 and 2100. It shows how much additional warming might occur even after CO2 emissions reach zero. Panel (c) estimates the NNCE required to bring warming back to 1.5°C by 2100 under different scenarios, including stabilizing warming at its peak and achieving a decline after stabilization. It highlights the potentially large amounts of CDR needed to counteract high warming outcomes.</p>

            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "We explore NNCE requirements for an illustrative pathway with the following characteristics (Fig. 2a)"</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Peak warming depends on the cumulative CO2 emissions until global net-zero CO2 and the stringency of reductions in non-CO2 GHGs. Achieving net-negative CO2 emissions (NNCE) after peak warming can result in a long-term decline in warming6. Most estimates of NNCE consistent with a long-term reversal of warming in peak and decline pathways have focused on median warming outcomes15. However, to comprehensively assess overshoot risks and NNCE requirements for warming reversal, uncertainties in the climate response must also be considered. These include uncertainties during the warming phase (for example, high warming outcomes due to amplifying warming feedbacks)18 and in the long-term state (potential for continued warming post-net-zero CO2 and the response of the climate system to NNCE)7. We explore NNCE requirements for an illustrative pathway with the following characteristics (Fig. 2a): (1) it achieves net-zero CO2 around mid-century; (2) limits median peak warming close to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels; and (3) requires no NNCE to do so (for the median warming outcome).</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure is central to the paper&#39;s argument about the uncertainties and potential scale of CDR required for temperature reversal.

            <h3>Relying on CDR</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses the challenges and potential overconfidence in relying on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) to achieve temperature declines after an overshoot. It highlights the uncertainties in CDR deployment, including technical, economic, and sustainability constraints. The section emphasizes the need for rapid emission reductions to minimize reliance on CDR and suggests a preventive CDR capacity to address potential high warming outcomes.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>CDR Deployment Uncertainties:</strong> The section highlights the uncertainties surrounding large-scale CDR deployment, including technical limitations, economic feasibility, and sustainability considerations. These uncertainties raise concerns about the reliability of CDR in achieving temperature reversal.</li><li><strong>Feasibility Concerns:</strong> The section discusses the feasibility challenges of scaling up CDR to the gigatonne level required for addressing climate uncertainty. Factors such as policy support, business models, technological readiness, and public acceptance are identified as potential bottlenecks.</li><li><strong>Harm Prevention Principle:</strong> The section introduces the harm prevention principle as a guide for CDR deployment pathways. This principle emphasizes the importance of reducing gross CO2 emissions to minimize CDR reliance and addressing feasibility concerns to enable CDR deployment beyond net-zero CO2.</li><li><strong>Preventive CDR Capacity:</strong> The section proposes the establishment of a preventive CDR capacity to hedge against potentially high warming outcomes. This capacity would involve developing and deploying CDR technologies beyond the levels needed for achieving net-zero CO2 emissions.</li><li><strong>Prioritizing Emission Reductions:</strong> The section reiterates the importance of rapid and stringent emission reductions to minimize the need for CDR and reduce climate risks. It argues that relying solely on CDR for temperature reversal is a risky strategy.</li></ul>

        <strong>Comprehensive Overview of CDR Challenges</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges associated with relying on CDR, including technical, economic, and sustainability aspects. This comprehensive approach ensures that readers understand the multifaceted nature of CDR deployment.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Here we highlight that there are multiple areas in which current pathways might be overconfident in their assumed use of CDR (Extended Data Table 2)." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Harm Prevention Principle</strong>
        <p>The introduction of the harm prevention principle provides a clear ethical framework for guiding CDR deployment decisions. This principle emphasizes the importance of minimizing potential harm and prioritizing proactive measures to reduce risks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We argue that deployment pathways that address this challenge should be guided by the principle of harm prevention29 under enhanced protection pathways (Table 1)." (Page 4)</div>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify the Preventive CDR Capacity</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions a preventive CDR capacity of &quot;several hundred gigatonnes,&quot; it could benefit from more specific quantification. This would provide a clearer understanding of the scale of CDR deployment needed to address high warming outcomes.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We argue that deployment pathways that address this challenge should be guided by the principle of harm prevention29 under enhanced protection pathways (Table 1)." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> More precise quantification would allow for a better assessment of the feasibility and implications of establishing a preventive CDR capacity.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a range or a best estimate for the preventive CDR capacity, perhaps based on specific scenarios or model simulations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Role of Policy and Governance</strong>
        <p>The section could elaborate on the role of policy and governance in facilitating the development and deployment of CDR. This would provide a more practical perspective on how to overcome the challenges associated with CDR.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Upscaling of CDR may be constrained considerably9 by factors such as lack of policy support and business models, technological uncertainty and public opposition (for example, perceived risks of delaying mitigation25)." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing the policy and governance aspects of CDR is crucial for ensuring its effective and responsible implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing specific policy instruments and governance mechanisms that could incentivize CDR development and deployment, such as carbon pricing, research and development funding, or international agreements.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores the regional impacts of climate change after an overshoot period, comparing them to scenarios where global warming is stabilized without overshoot. Even if global temperatures are reversed, regional climates might not simply return to their previous states. The authors use model simulations to show that regional climate change can differ significantly between overshoot and stabilization scenarios, particularly in the North Atlantic and adjacent European land regions. These differences are attributed to the time-lagged response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The key takeaway is that regional climate change is complex and cannot be accurately predicted solely based on global average temperature changes, especially after an overshoot.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Regional Differences in Overshoot vs. Stabilization:</strong> The section highlights that even if global warming is reversed after an overshoot, regional climates might not return to their previous states. Model simulations show substantial differences in regional climate impact drivers between overshoot and stabilization scenarios.</li><li><strong>North Atlantic and European Impacts:</strong> The North Atlantic and adjacent European land regions show distinct responses to overshoot, including temporary cooling and subsequent warming, related to the time-lagged response of the AMOC.</li><li><strong>AMOC Dynamics:</strong> The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a crucial role in shaping regional climate responses to overshoot. Its time-lagged response can lead to complex and unexpected regional climate patterns.</li><li><strong>Precipitation Changes:</strong> Similar to temperature, regional precipitation patterns also show distinct responses to overshoot and stabilization, particularly due to shifts in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone related to AMOC changes.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Global Mean Temperature:</strong> The section emphasizes that regional climate changes cannot be accurately predicted solely based on changes in global mean surface air temperature (GMST), especially after an overshoot.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Focus on Regional Impacts</strong>
        <p>The section effectively focuses on the regional implications of overshoot, which is a crucial aspect often overlooked in global climate change discussions. This regional focus provides valuable insights for adaptation planning and risk assessment.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Even if global temperatures are reversed, this is not a given for regional climatic changes. Therefore, understanding the implications of a global temperature overshoot for regional changes is important." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Use of Model Simulations</strong>
        <p>The use of model simulations from NorESM2-LM and GFDL-ESM2M provides concrete evidence for the differences in regional climate responses between overshoot and stabilization scenarios. This strengthens the section&#39;s arguments and provides a basis for further investigation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Here we explore a unique set of dedicated modelling simulations comparing overshoot and long-term stabilization in two ESMs and find substantial differences in regional climate impact drivers on multi-century timescales (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5)." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Implications for Adaptation</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions the importance of understanding regional impacts for adaptation, it could expand on the specific implications for adaptation planning. This would provide more practical guidance for policymakers and stakeholders.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Connecting the findings to adaptation strategies would enhance the section&#39;s relevance and usefulness for practical applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing how the regional differences between overshoot and stabilization scenarios could inform adaptation measures, such as infrastructure development, water resource management, or coastal protection.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Uncertainties in Regional Projections</strong>
        <p>The section could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the uncertainties associated with regional climate projections. This would provide a more balanced perspective and acknowledge the limitations of current modeling capabilities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging uncertainties is crucial for responsible scientific communication and informed decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing the sources of uncertainty in regional climate projections, such as model limitations, emission pathway uncertainties, or the representation of feedback mechanisms.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the Differences Between the Two Models</strong>
        <p>The section mentions differences in model dynamics between NorESM2-LM and GFDL-ESM2M. Clarifying these differences and their potential implications for the results would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, substantial differences in model dynamics (compare Fig. 3e,f) remain." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the model-specific differences is important for interpreting the results and assessing the robustness of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed explanation of the key differences between the two models, such as their representation of AMOC or other relevant processes, and discuss how these differences might affect the regional climate projections.</p>

        <summary>figure 3</summary>
        <p>Figure 3 compares regional temperature changes after a period of overshoot (temporarily exceeding a target temperature) with regional temperature changes under a stabilization scenario (where the target temperature is not exceeded). It uses two different climate models (NorESM and GFDL-ESM2M) and shows how temperatures in specific regions, like the North Atlantic and Western/Northern Europe, respond differently to overshoot compared to stabilization. Panels (a) and (b) show the global mean surface air temperature (GMST) over time for both scenarios. Panels (c) and (d) show how the relationship between regional temperatures and global temperature changes over time. Panels (e) and (f) show the difference in regional temperatures between the overshoot and stabilization scenarios after 100 years of stable global temperatures. Imagine the Earth as a giant bathtub: even if the overall water level (global temperature) stabilizes, the water temperature in different parts of the tub (regions) might not be the same, especially if there was a period of higher water levels (overshoot).</p>

        <p>Extended Data Figure 4 shows the CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2fe) used in the overshoot and stabilization simulations for the two climate models (GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM). CO2fe combines the warming effects of all greenhouse gases, not just CO2. Panels (a) and (c) show the emissions over time for both scenarios. Panels (b) and (d) show the difference in the total amount of CO2fe emitted between the overshoot and stabilization scenarios, separated into the period when temperatures are increasing (&#39;upward phase&#39;) and the period when temperatures are decreasing (&#39;downward phase&#39;). Think of it like comparing the fuel consumption of two cars driving the same distance: one car accelerates quickly and then brakes hard (overshoot), while the other maintains a steady speed (stabilization). The total fuel consumed might be different, and the difference will be most pronounced during acceleration and braking.</p>

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 5 compares regional precipitation patterns before and after a period of temperature overshoot with patterns seen under global temperature stabilization. It uses two Earth System Models (ESMs), NorESM and GFDL-ESM2M. Panels (a) and (b) show how global temperature changes over time in each model under both overshoot and stabilization scenarios. Panels (c) and (d) show how precipitation in specific regions (global land, global ocean, Amazon, Mediterranean) changes relative to global temperature change. Think of it like comparing how rainfall in your garden changes with the overall temperature in your city versus in a nearby town with a different climate. Panels (e) and (f) are maps showing the differences in precipitation between overshoot and stabilization scenarios after the global temperature has stabilized. Areas with significant differences are hatched. Imagine comparing two maps of average rainfall after a heatwave: one where the heatwave was followed by a return to normal temperatures, and one where temperatures stayed high.</p>

Each of the first 12 panels represents a different climate model&#39;s projection of temperature change. The colors on the maps show how much warmer or cooler a region is after the overshoot compared to before the overshoot, when global mean temperatures are 0.2°C below the peak warming. Hatching indicates areas where the change is statistically significant, meaning it&#39;s likely not just random variation.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section emphasizes that certain climate impacts, even after a temperature overshoot and subsequent decline, will not immediately reverse. These impacts include changes in the deep ocean, marine ecosystems, land-based ecosystems, carbon stocks, crop yields, and biodiversity. Sea levels, for example, will continue to rise for centuries even if temperatures decrease. The section also highlights the importance of considering not only the irreversible consequences of an overshoot but also the benefits of long-term temperature decline compared to stabilizing at a higher temperature.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>Irreversible Impacts:</strong> The section identifies several climate impacts that are not expected to reverse immediately after an overshoot, including changes in the deep ocean, marine ecosystems, land-based ecosystems, carbon stocks, crop yields, and biodiversity. These impacts have long-term consequences that extend beyond the timeframe of temperature reversal.</li><li><strong>Sea-Level Rise Commitment:</strong> Sea levels will continue to rise for centuries to millennia even if temperatures decline, highlighting the long-term commitment associated with even temporary temperature increases. This has significant implications for coastal communities and ecosystems.</li><li><strong>Earth System Tipping Elements:</strong> An overshoot increases the probability of triggering tipping elements in the Earth system, which can lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in climate patterns. This underscores the importance of avoiding even temporary exceedances of temperature limits.</li><li><strong>Benefits of Long-Term Temperature Decline:</strong> The section emphasizes the importance of considering the benefits of long-term temperature decline, compared to stabilization at higher levels, in mitigating climate risks. This highlights the value of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, which can lead to sustained temperature reductions.</li><li><strong>Need for Comprehensive Risk Assessment:</strong> A comprehensive assessment of future climate risks requires considering both the irreversible impacts of overshoot and the potential benefits of long-term temperature decline. This underscores the need for a nuanced approach to climate risk management.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Identification of Irreversible Impacts</strong>
        <p>The section clearly identifies a range of climate impacts that are not expected to reverse immediately after an overshoot. This provides a valuable overview of the long-term consequences of exceeding temperature limits.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For a range of climate impacts, there is no expectation of immediate reversibility after an overshoot. This includes changes in the deep ocean, marine biogeochemistry and species abundance34, land-based biomes, carbon stocks and crop yields35, but also biodiversity on land36." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Sea-Level Rise</strong>
        <p>The section highlights the long-term commitment to sea-level rise, even with temperature decline. This emphasizes a critical and widely understood impact of climate change with significant consequences for coastal regions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Sea levels will continue to rise for centuries to millennia even if long-term temperatures decline37." (Page 5)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify the Irreversible Impacts</strong>
        <p>While the section identifies irreversible impacts, it could benefit from quantifying these impacts whenever possible. This would provide a more concrete understanding of the magnitude of the long-term consequences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying the impacts would make the risks more tangible and facilitate comparisons between different impacts and scenarios.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Where possible, provide estimates or ranges for the magnitude of irreversible impacts, such as the extent of sea-level rise commitment or the potential loss of biodiversity under different overshoot scenarios.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Timescales of Irreversibility</strong>
        <p>The section mentions that some impacts are irreversible, but it could benefit from discussing the timescales of irreversibility. This would provide a clearer understanding of the long-term implications of overshoot.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the timescales of irreversibility is crucial for long-term planning and adaptation strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each irreversible impact, provide an estimate or a range for the time it would take for the system to recover, if at all, after temperatures decline. This could be expressed in years, decades, centuries, or millennia, depending on the specific impact.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect to Specific Tipping Elements</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the increased probability of triggering tipping elements. Connecting this to specific tipping elements, such as the collapse of ice sheets or the dieback of the Amazon rainforest, would make the risks more concrete and relatable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"An overshoot will also increase the probability of triggering potential Earth system tipping elements33." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing specific tipping elements would provide a more compelling and understandable illustration of the potential consequences of overshoot.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide examples of specific tipping elements that are particularly vulnerable to temperature overshoot and briefly explain the potential consequences of their activation.</p>

        <p>Figure 4 illustrates the long-term irreversible impacts of overshooting the 1.5°C warming limit on permafrost, peatlands, and sea-level rise. Panel (a) shows how the length of time we spend above 1.5°C affects both the global temperature increase caused by permafrost and peatland emissions (blue) and the sea level rise (purple) by the year 2300. The longer the overshoot, the greater these impacts. Think of it like leaving ice cream out in the sun: the longer it sits, the more it melts. Panel (b) compares two scenarios: one where we only achieve net-zero CO2 emissions (stabilizing temperatures at their peak), and one where we achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (leading to a long-term temperature decline). It shows that achieving net-zero GHG emissions significantly reduces the additional temperature increase and sea-level rise in 2300 compared to just stabilizing CO2 emissions. It&#39;s like comparing the final mess after spilling two different liquids: one that evaporates quickly (GHG scenario) and one that leaves a sticky residue (CO2 only scenario).</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Comprehensively assessing future climate risks under peak and decline pathways requires a focus not only on the (irreversible) consequences of a temporary overshoot but also on the benefits of long-term temperature reversal, compared with stabilization at higher levels. Here we explore the consequences of overshoot in an ensemble of peak and decline pathways (Methods) that achieve net-zero GHGs and thereby long-term temperature decline compared with stabilization at peak warming (by maintaining net-zero CO2). For global sea-level rise, we find that every 100 years of overshoot above 1.5 °C leads to an additional sea-level rise commitment of around 40 cm by 2300 (central estimate) apart from a baseline of about 80 cm without overshoot (Fig. 4a).</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure emphasizes the long-term consequences of overshooting the 1.5°C warming limit, even if temperatures eventually decline. It highlights the irreversible nature of some climate impacts, like sea-level rise and permafrost thaw, and the importance of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions rather than just net-zero CO2 emissions.</p>

Panel (a) shows the relationship between the duration of overshoot above 1.5°C and the resulting feedback on global mean temperature from permafrost and peatland emissions (blue markers) and the 95th percentile sea-level rise (purple markers) in 2300.

            <h3>Socioeconomic impacts</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses the societal and economic consequences of a temperature overshoot. It emphasizes that the severity of climate risks during an overshoot depends heavily on the adaptive capacity of human systems, particularly in the first half of the 21st century when adaptive capacity is projected to be relatively low, even under optimistic development scenarios. The coincidence of overshoot with low adaptive capacity can amplify climate risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. The section also highlights the potential for lasting negative impacts on human well-being, including climate-related deaths, and the long-term economic consequences, especially for less developed countries. It raises ethical concerns about the extent of loss and damage that vulnerable populations might face due to overshoot.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Adaptive Capacity and Risk Amplification:</strong> The section emphasizes that the severity of climate risks during an overshoot is strongly influenced by the adaptive capacity of human systems. Low adaptive capacity, particularly in the near term, can amplify the negative impacts of overshoot.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability of Low-Income Countries:</strong> The section highlights the disproportionate impact of overshoot on vulnerable countries, communities, and people, particularly those in low-income countries with limited resources and adaptive capacity.</li><li><strong>Intergenerational Impacts:</strong> The section points out that climate impacts on health, ecosystem services, livelihoods, and education can have lasting and intergenerational effects on human well-being, raising concerns about the long-term consequences of overshoot.</li><li><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong> Overshoots can have long-term negative impacts on the economic performance of countries, especially those least developed, due to the lasting effects of climate change on economic growth.</li><li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> The section raises ethical questions about the amount of additional climate-related loss and damage that people, especially in low-income countries, might endure due to overshoot. This highlights the ethical dimensions of considering overshoot pathways.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Focus on Human Impacts</strong>
        <p>The section effectively focuses on the human dimensions of overshoot, highlighting the socioeconomic consequences and the differential impacts on vulnerable populations. This focus is crucial for understanding the broader implications of overshoot beyond biophysical changes.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The severity of climate risks for human systems under overshoot depends markedly on their adaptive capacity38, as well as the potential transgression of limits to adaptation39." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Adaptive Capacity</strong>
        <p>The section correctly emphasizes the role of adaptive capacity in shaping the impacts of overshoot. This highlights the importance of investing in adaptation measures and building resilience, particularly in vulnerable regions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"An overshoot above 1.5°C would likely emerge during the first half of the twenty-first century, a period still characterized by comparably low adaptive capacity in large parts of the globe even under optimistic scenarios of socioeconomic development38." (Page 6)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Specific Examples</strong>
        <p>While the section discusses socioeconomic impacts in general terms, it could benefit from more specific examples of how overshoot might affect different sectors or communities. This would make the impacts more tangible and relatable for readers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would enhance the section&#39;s impact and provide a clearer understanding of the potential consequences of overshoot.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include specific examples of how overshoot could affect sectors like agriculture, health, or infrastructure, or how it might disproportionately impact specific communities, such as coastal populations or those reliant on climate-sensitive resources.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify the Socioeconomic Impacts</strong>
        <p>The section could be strengthened by quantifying the socioeconomic impacts of overshoot whenever possible. This would provide a more precise understanding of the potential costs and benefits of different scenarios.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying the impacts would facilitate comparisons between different scenarios and inform policy decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Where possible, provide estimates or ranges for the economic costs of overshoot, such as the potential losses in GDP or the costs of adaptation measures. This could be based on existing research or model simulations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Potential Solutions and Strategies</strong>
        <p>While the section focuses on the negative impacts of overshoot, it could also briefly discuss potential solutions and strategies for mitigating these impacts. This would provide a more balanced perspective and offer some hope for addressing the challenges.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing potential solutions would enhance the section&#39;s practical relevance and provide readers with a sense of agency.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing potential strategies for building adaptive capacity, reducing vulnerability, and addressing the ethical concerns associated with overshoot. This could include examples of successful adaptation measures, international cooperation initiatives, or policy interventions.</p>

            <h3>Adaptation decision-making and overshoot</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section examines the relevance of potential long-term impact reversals after a temperature overshoot for current adaptation planning. It argues that the long timescales involved in such reversals (50 years or more) often exceed the typical planning horizons of adaptation plans and infrastructure lifecycles. The section also discusses the influence of discount rates on adaptation decisions, noting that higher rates prioritize near-term costs and benefits, making adaptation to peak warming seemingly more attractive than adapting to a potentially lower long-term outcome. The section concludes that long-term reversibility may only be relevant in specific adaptation decisions, particularly those involving irreversible impacts like sea-level rise. However, given the uncertainty of achieving temperature decline after overshoot, limiting peak warming remains crucial for effective adaptation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Timescales of Impact Reversal:</strong> The section highlights that the timescales for potential impact reversals after an overshoot are often much longer than the typical planning horizons used in adaptation plans. This mismatch raises questions about the practical relevance of long-term reversals for current adaptation decisions.</li><li><strong>Adaptation Planning Horizons:</strong> Most adaptation plans and policies operate on timescales of decades, much shorter than the potential multi-decadal timescales of impact reversal. This temporal mismatch limits the consideration of long-term reversals in current adaptation planning.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure Lifecycles:</strong> The lifecycles of infrastructure, while sometimes spanning a century or more, are often managed through shorter-term budget cycles and concession periods. This focus on shorter timescales can overshadow the relevance of long-term impact reversals in infrastructure planning.</li><li><strong>Discount Rates and Intergenerational Equity:</strong> The section discusses how discount rates, reflecting intergenerational equity considerations, influence adaptation decisions. Higher discount rates prioritize near-term costs and benefits, potentially favoring adaptation to peak warming over adaptation to a lower long-term outcome.</li><li><strong>Irreversible Impacts and Adaptation:</strong> The section acknowledges that long-term impact reversibility may be relevant for adaptation decisions related to irreversible impacts like sea-level rise. However, the uncertainty of achieving temperature decline after overshoot underscores the importance of limiting peak warming to reduce adaptation needs.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Focus on Practical Relevance</strong>
        <p>The section effectively addresses the practical relevance of long-term impact reversals for adaptation planning. By comparing the timescales of reversal with typical planning horizons, it highlights the potential disconnect between long-term climate projections and near-term adaptation needs.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This poses the question of whether the possibility of impact reversal in the long-term future is relevant for adaptation planning today, in comparison with the more imminent threat of near-term climate change and the magnitude of peak warming43." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consideration of Discount Rates</strong>
        <p>The discussion of discount rates and intergenerational equity adds an important economic and ethical dimension to the analysis. It highlights how different discount rates can influence adaptation decisions and prioritize short-term versus long-term considerations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Higher discount rates limit the time horizon relevant for economic adaptation decision-making to a few decades (Fig. 5b), in which case adapting to peak warming might always be preferable to adapting to a lower long-term outcome." (Page 7)</div>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Concrete Examples of Adaptation Measures</strong>
        <p>While the section discusses adaptation planning in general terms, it could benefit from providing more concrete examples of specific adaptation measures and how they are affected by the timescales of impact reversal. This would make the discussion more practical and relatable for readers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would enhance the section&#39;s practical relevance and provide a clearer understanding of the challenges and opportunities for adaptation planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include examples of specific adaptation measures, such as coastal protection, water resource management, or agricultural practices, and discuss how the timescales of impact reversal might influence the design and implementation of these measures.</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Explore the Role of Uncertainty in Adaptation Planning</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the uncertainty of achieving temperature decline after overshoot. However, it could further explore how this uncertainty should be incorporated into adaptation planning processes. This would provide more practical guidance for decision-makers facing uncertain future climate conditions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, as we have shown above, long-term global temperature decline cannot be relied on with certainty." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing uncertainty explicitly in adaptation planning is crucial for developing robust and flexible strategies that can cope with a range of possible future outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss specific approaches for incorporating uncertainty into adaptation planning, such as scenario planning, robust decision-making, or adaptive management. Provide examples of how these approaches have been used in practice.</p>

        <p>Figure 5 illustrates the timescales relevant for adaptation planning in the context of a potential temperature overshoot. Panel (a) shows two stylized examples of how a climate impact driver (like sea level or drought intensity) might change over time under a peak and decline temperature scenario. The green shaded areas represent the period of overshoot, with the dashed lines showing different possible overshoot magnitudes and durations. Panel (b) visualizes the time horizons typically considered in adaptation planning (decadal, multi-decadal) and the lifetimes of various adaptation measures, ranging from annual adjustments (like crop choices) to long-term infrastructure projects (like dams). It also shows how different discount rates, which reflect how we value future costs and benefits, can influence the effective time horizon for adaptation decisions. The higher the discount rate, the less we value future impacts, and the shorter the effective planning horizon becomes.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Even under the optimistic assumption of nearly full reversibility of a climate impact driver under overshoot, a planning horizon of 50 years or more might be required before prospects of a long-term decline would start to affect adaptation decisions today or in the immediate future (Fig. 5a). Few adaptation plans and policies operate on these timescales: for example, the EU Adaptation Strategy spans three decades, whereas other national adaptation plans have similar or shorter time horizons44.</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure is crucial for understanding the challenge of incorporating long-term temperature decline into near-term adaptation planning. It highlights the mismatch between the timescales of overshoot and reversal and the typical time horizons considered in adaptation decisions. This mismatch suggests that the potential for future temperature decline might not be a primary factor in current adaptation planning.</p>

            <h3>Reframing the overshoot discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section argues against framing overshoot as a viable alternative for achieving desired climate outcomes. It highlights that climate impacts differ significantly between a world with overshoot and one without, emphasizing that impact reversibility is not guaranteed. Even when reversible, the timescales often exceed typical adaptation planning horizons. The section underscores the ethical implications of overshoot, particularly the irreversible socioeconomic impacts and disproportionate burden on vulnerable populations. It also cautions against relying on solar geoengineering as a solution, citing concerns about its effectiveness and governance. The section concludes by advocating for a reframing of the overshoot discussion to prioritize minimizing climate risks, accelerating emission reductions, and developing a preventive carbon dioxide removal (CDR) capacity to hedge against high-risk outcomes.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Overshoot is Not an Alternative:</strong> The section argues against viewing overshoot as simply a different path to a similar climate outcome. It emphasizes the distinct and potentially irreversible impacts of overshoot compared to scenarios without overshoot.</li><li><strong>Irreversible Impacts and Timescales:</strong> The section highlights that many climate impacts are not fully reversible, and even when reversibility is possible, the timescales often exceed typical adaptation planning horizons. This underscores the limitations of relying on future reversal to justify current inaction.</li><li><strong>Ethical Dimensions of Overshoot:</strong> The section emphasizes the ethical implications of overshoot, particularly the irreversible socioeconomic impacts and the disproportionate burden of loss and damage on vulnerable populations, especially in low-income countries.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Solar Geoengineering:</strong> The section cautions against relying on solar geoengineering as a solution to overshoot, citing concerns about its effectiveness, governance, and potential unintended consequences.</li><li><strong>Need for Risk Minimization:</strong> The section advocates for reframing the overshoot discussion to prioritize minimizing climate risks, both in the near term and long term. This includes accelerating emission reductions and developing a preventive CDR capacity.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear and Concise Argument</strong>
        <p>The section presents a clear and concise argument against framing overshoot as a viable alternative. It effectively summarizes the key findings of the paper and synthesizes them into a compelling narrative.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this Article, we argue that it is misleading to frame overshoot as an alternative way to achieve a similar climate outcome." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Ethical Considerations</strong>
        <p>The section explicitly addresses the ethical dimensions of overshoot, highlighting the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. This ethical focus adds an important dimension to the discussion and underscores the social justice implications of climate change.</p>
        <div class="quote">"From a climate justice perspective, overshoot entails socioeconomic impacts and climate-related loss and damage that are typically irreversible and fall most severely on poor people." (Page 7)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Preventive CDR Capacity</strong>
        <p>While the section advocates for a preventive CDR capacity, it could provide more details on what this capacity would entail in terms of specific technologies, deployment scales, and governance mechanisms. This would make the recommendation more concrete and actionable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Based on these insights, we argue for a reframing of the science and policy discourse on overshoot to focus on minimizing climate risks in peak and decline temperature pathways (Table 1)." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more details on the preventive CDR capacity would strengthen the recommendation and provide a clearer roadmap for implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing specific CDR technologies, their potential deployment scales, and the governance mechanisms needed to ensure their effective and responsible use. This could include examples of existing CDR projects or policy proposals.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Role of Public Communication</strong>
        <p>The section could benefit from discussing the role of public communication in reframing the overshoot discussion. Public understanding and acceptance of the risks and limitations of overshoot are crucial for mobilizing support for ambitious climate action.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing public communication is essential for fostering informed public discourse and building consensus on climate policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or a few sentences discussing the importance of communicating the risks of overshoot to the public and engaging stakeholders in discussions about alternative pathways. This could include recommendations for effective communication strategies or examples of successful public engagement initiatives.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the methodologies employed to analyze the climate impacts of overshoot pathways. It describes the use of the FaIR (Finite Amplitude Impulse Response) model to estimate net-negative CO2 emission (NNCE) needs under climate uncertainty, and the use of two Earth System Models (ESMs), GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM2-LM, to investigate regional climate change reversibility under overshoot and stabilization scenarios. The section also outlines the methods used to project long-term impacts on sea-level rise, permafrost, and peatlands, and the analysis of CMIP6 model projections.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>NNCE Needs Estimation:</strong> The FaIR model is used to estimate the required NNCE for an illustrative emission pathway, considering uncertainties in climate response. This involves calculating climate response metrics like eTCREup, eTCREdown, and eZEC, and estimating the cumulative NNCE needed to return warming to 1.5°C by 2100.</li><li><strong>Regional Climate Change Reversibility:</strong> Simulations from GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM2-LM are used to compare regional climate changes under overshoot and stabilization scenarios. The analysis focuses on the time-lagged response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its influence on regional temperature and precipitation patterns.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Impact Projections:</strong> Sea-level rise, permafrost thaw, and peatland carbon emissions are projected using scenario ensembles and specialized models. The analysis quantifies the long-term impacts of overshoot on these systems, considering both net-zero GHG and net-zero CO2 scenarios.</li><li><strong>CMIP6 Model Analysis:</strong> Climate projections from 12 CMIP6 ESMs are analyzed to assess regional temperature and precipitation changes before and after overshoot. The analysis focuses on identifying consistent patterns across models and quantifying the differences between overshoot and stabilization scenarios.</li></ul>

        <p>Extended Data Figure 1 illustrates the method used to derive the necessary amount of net-negative CO2 emissions (NNCE) under conditions of climate uncertainty, specifically for the PROVIDE REN_NZCO2 scenario. This scenario initially assumes net-zero CO2 emissions around 2060. Panel (a) shows the original scenario (in black) alongside modified versions where varying levels of NNCE are introduced after 2060. These modifications help explore how different amounts of CO2 removal affect temperature change. Panel (b) shows the difference in warming between 2100 and 2060 for each scenario. The red highlight indicates the scenario where 20 Gt of CO2 is removed annually. Values to the right of the purple line represent continued warming, even with CO2 removal. Panel (c) shows the relationship between two metrics: eTCREup (how much warming occurs for a given amount of CO2 emissions *before* net-zero) and eTCREdown (how much cooling occurs for a given amount of CO2 removal *after* net-zero). Panel (d) compares the cooling between 2100 and 2060 with the warming in 2060. This helps visualize how much CO2 removal is needed to offset the warming that has already occurred.</p>
