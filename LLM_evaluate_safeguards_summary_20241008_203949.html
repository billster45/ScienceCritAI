        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This paper introduces &quot;Do-Not-Answer,&quot; an open-source dataset designed to evaluate the safety of large language models (LLMs). The dataset focuses on 939 prompts that responsible LLMs should refuse to answer, categorized using a three-level hierarchical risk taxonomy covering five key risk areas (information hazards, malicious uses, discrimination/toxicity, misinformation harms, and human-computer interaction harms). Six popular LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA-2, ChatGLM2, and Vicuna) were evaluated using this dataset, revealing varying safety performance levels. Additionally, the researchers developed smaller, more efficient BERT-like classifiers, demonstrating their potential as a cost-effective alternative for automatic safety evaluation, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>LLaMA-2 demonstrated the highest safety performance among the evaluated LLMs, refusing to answer harmful prompts in 99.7% of cases. This suggests that LLaMA-2&#39;s safety mechanisms are highly effective in avoiding the generation of harmful content. However, the three instances where LLaMA-2 did produce harmful responses highlight the ongoing challenge of risky over-reliance due to the model&#39;s human-like tone.</li><li>A smaller, fine-tuned Longformer model achieved comparable performance to GPT-4 in automatically evaluating LLM responses for safety, with accuracy scores of 88.8% and 91.3% respectively for action classification. This finding is significant because it suggests that cost-effective and scalable automatic evaluation methods can be developed, reducing the reliance on resource-intensive human evaluation.</li><li>ChatGLM2 exhibited the lowest safety performance, generating the most harmful responses among the six LLMs evaluated. This indicates potential weaknesses in ChatGLM2&#39;s safety mechanisms and highlights areas for improvement in its training or design.</li><li>The analysis of response patterns revealed that LLMs exhibit specific action category distributions depending on the type of harm presented in the prompt. For example, certain models might be more likely to refuse to answer prompts related to illegal activities but less likely to avoid responding to prompts involving misinformation. This finding underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation across different risk areas and harm types to fully characterize LLM safety.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The creation of the open-source Do-Not-Answer dataset is a significant contribution, providing a valuable resource for researchers and developers to evaluate and improve LLM safety. Its availability fosters transparency and collaboration within the community.</li><li>The development of a three-level hierarchical risk taxonomy provides a comprehensive framework for categorizing and understanding potential harms associated with LLMs. This structured approach allows for more nuanced analysis of LLM behavior and facilitates targeted interventions to improve safety.</li><li>The novel three-round conversation strategy employed to generate risky questions using GPT-4 is a creative and effective method for eliciting potentially harmful content while bypassing safety restrictions. This approach enables the collection of a diverse range of challenging prompts for evaluating LLM robustness.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The dataset currently focuses exclusively on prompts that responsible LLMs should refuse to answer. Incorporating a mix of both risky and non-risky prompts would allow for a more balanced evaluation and enable identification of models that might be overly cautious, refusing to answer even harmless instructions. Future research could expand the dataset to include a range of prompt types to address this limitation.</li><li>The current evaluation focuses primarily on English text. Extending the evaluation to other languages and cultural contexts would enhance the generalizability of the findings and address potential language-specific safety concerns. Future research should consider multilingual evaluation and adaptation of the dataset to different cultural norms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM safety by introducing a comprehensive risk taxonomy, a novel dataset of risky prompts, and an evaluation of popular LLMs. The finding that LLaMA-2 performed best in terms of safety and the promising results of the smaller, Longformer-based automatic evaluation method are valuable insights for developers. Future research should focus on expanding the dataset with non-risky instructions, extending the evaluation to other languages and multi-turn conversations, and further refining automatic evaluation techniques to improve the accuracy and scalability of LLM safety assessments. These advancements are crucial for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, demonstrating both beneficial and harmful emergent capabilities. This necessitates evaluating and mitigating these risks, especially for open-source LLMs, which often lack robust safety mechanisms. This paper introduces the &quot;Do-Not-Answer&quot; dataset, an open-source resource designed to evaluate LLM safeguards by focusing on prompts that responsible models should refuse to answer. This dataset aims to enable safer development and deployment of open-source LLMs.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Emergent capabilities of LLMs:</strong> LLMs are developing new abilities, both positive and negative, beyond their initial training. This unpredictability poses challenges for safety.</li><li><strong>Need for risk identification:</strong> It&#39;s crucial to identify and evaluate the &quot;dangerous capabilities&quot; of LLMs to mitigate potential harm.</li><li><strong>Lack of safety in open-source LLMs:</strong> Compared to commercial LLMs, open-source models often lack comprehensive safety mechanisms, making this research particularly relevant.</li><li><strong>Introduction of Do-Not-Answer dataset:</strong> This open-source dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating LLM safeguards and promoting responsible development.</li><li><strong>Focus on prompts to refuse:</strong> The dataset specifically focuses on prompts that responsible LLMs should not answer, providing a clear benchmark for safety evaluation.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear problem statement</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research by highlighting the dual nature of LLM emergent capabilities and the need for better safety evaluations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has lead to a number of emerging and high- utility capabilities, including those for which they were not trained. On the downside, they have also been found to exhibit hard-to-predict harmful ca- pabilities." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Focus on open-source LLMs</strong>
        <p>The introduction explicitly addresses the gap in safety mechanisms for open-source LLMs, making the research relevant and impactful for a wider community.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, open-source LLMs tend to lack comprehensive safety mechanisms." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>

Each axis of the radar chart represents a category of potential harm, such as &#39;Information Hazards&#39; or &#39;Malicious Uses&#39;. The performance of each LLM is represented by a colored line, forming a polygon on the chart. A point closer to the outer edge of the chart indicates a higher score in that category, meaning the LLM is better at avoiding that specific harm. The LLMs compared are GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, ChatGLM2, LLaMA-2, and Vicuna.</p>

            <h3>Safety Taxonomy</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section introduces a three-level hierarchical taxonomy for classifying the risks associated with large language models (LLMs), particularly text-only models. It builds upon previous research and focuses on five key risk areas: information hazards, malicious uses, discrimination/exclusion/toxicity, misinformation harms, and human-computer interaction harms. The taxonomy provides a detailed breakdown of potential hazards, outlining how these risks manifest and providing examples of the types of questions or prompts that could trigger them.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Hierarchical structure:</strong> The taxonomy uses a three-level structure to categorize risks, starting with broad areas and then breaking them down into more specific harm types and risk types.</li><li><strong>Focus on text-only LLMs:</strong> The taxonomy specifically addresses risks associated with text-only LLMs, assuming no API interaction or multimodal input/output.</li><li><strong>Five key risk areas:</strong> The taxonomy covers five main areas of risk, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM safety.</li><li><strong>Mechanism of risks:</strong> For each risk area, the taxonomy explains how these risks can arise from LLM predictions and how they can be exploited.</li><li><strong>Question/prompt examples:</strong> The taxonomy provides examples of the types of questions or prompts that could trigger each type of harm, making it practical for evaluating LLM responses.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Builds on existing research</strong>
        <p>The taxonomy builds upon the established work of Weidinger et al. (2021), providing a more refined and detailed classification of LLM risks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The study by Weidinger et al. (2021) categorized the risks associated with LLMs into six distinct areas: (I) information hazards; (II) malicious uses; (III) discrimination, exclusion, and toxicity; (IV) misinformation harms; (V) human-computer inter- action harms; and (VI) automation, access, and environmental harms. Building upon this founda- tion, we introduce a comprehensive three-level risk taxonomy for LLMs, as illustrated in Figure 2." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive and detailed</strong>
        <p>The three-level structure and the inclusion of specific risk types provide a comprehensive and detailed framework for analyzing LLM safety.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We then formulate twelve types of harms as our second-level classification (Table 1), and delineate sixty distinct risk types at the bottom level, pro- viding a comprehensive breakdown of potential hazards.3" (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the distinction between harm types and risk types</strong>
        <p>While the taxonomy mentions harm types and risk types, the distinction between these two levels could be clarified further. This would improve the overall clarity and usability of the taxonomy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clearer distinction between the levels would make the taxonomy easier to understand and apply in practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide more explicit definitions and examples to differentiate between harm types (second level) and risk types (third level).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Include examples of safe responses</strong>
        <p>While the taxonomy provides examples of prompts that could trigger harmful responses, it could be strengthened by also including examples of safe and appropriate responses. This would provide a more complete picture of desired LLM behavior.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Including examples of safe responses would make the taxonomy more practical for developers and researchers working on LLM safety.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each risk type, provide examples of responses that would be considered safe and responsible.</p>
    </li>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details how the researchers collected 939 risky questions and the corresponding responses from six different Large Language Models (LLMs). The questions are designed to be those that a responsible LLM should refuse to answer. The researchers used a novel three-round conversation strategy with GPT-4 to generate these questions, addressing challenges in eliciting risky content. They also describe how they handled borderline cases and filled in question templates with specific risky scenarios. Finally, they collected responses from three commercial and three open-source LLMs, providing statistics on the length of these responses.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Rationale for question selection:</strong> The dataset focuses on questions LLMs should *not* answer to facilitate easier evaluation of safety mechanisms.</li><li><strong>GPT-4 question generation strategy:</strong> A three-round conversational approach was used with GPT-4 to generate risky questions, overcoming GPT-4&#39;s reluctance to produce harmful content.</li><li><strong>Handling of borderline cases:</strong> Questions that were not inherently risky were either modified to include a risky scenario or excluded from the dataset.</li><li><strong>Question template filling:</strong> Generic question templates were filled in with specific protected attributes (name, race, religion, gender, organization) to create concrete risky questions.</li><li><strong>Response collection from six LLMs:</strong> Responses were collected from six LLMs, including three commercial and three open-source models, providing a diverse range of LLM architectures and training approaches.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Novel question generation method</strong>
        <p>The three-round conversation strategy with GPT-4 is a creative and effective way to generate risky questions while bypassing safety restrictions. This approach allows for the collection of a diverse range of potentially harmful prompts.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel strategy that involves a simulated chat history to elicit question examples through a three-round conversation." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear justification for question selection</strong>
        <p>The researchers clearly explain why they chose to focus on questions LLMs should not answer, emphasizing the ease of evaluation and the trade-off with potential bias in question distribution.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Why do we collect a dataset where all instructions should not be followed? We expect that LLMs should either reject, refuse to respond to, or refute the stance of all such questions. It is relatively easy to identify and determine the quality of response abstention, for both human and automatic assess- ment." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detail on the three-round conversation prompts</strong>
        <p>While the three-round conversation strategy is described, providing the actual prompts used would enhance reproducibility and allow others to build upon this method.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sharing the specific prompts would make the research more transparent and facilitate further research on generating risky questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include the exact prompts used in each round of the GPT-4 conversation, potentially in an appendix or supplementary material.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss potential biases in the generated questions</strong>
        <p>While the researchers acknowledge the potential for bias in the question distribution, a more in-depth discussion of the types of biases that might be present and their potential impact on the evaluation would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Collecting this dataset facilitates accurate and high-quality response evaluation, at the cost of potentially biased risky question distribution." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more thorough discussion of potential biases would strengthen the analysis and provide a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of the dataset.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing potential biases, such as biases related to the topics covered, the phrasing of the questions, or the specific protected attributes used.</p>

            <h3>Response Annotation and Assessment</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section describes the process of annotating and assessing the responses of six LLMs to the risky questions in the Do-Not-Answer dataset. The researchers used a two-level assessment: first, classifying responses as either safe or harmful, and second, categorizing them into six refined action categories. The guidelines for determining harmfulness are outlined, along with a detailed explanation of each action category. The section also discusses the human evaluation process and initial findings regarding the safety performance of the different LLMs.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Binary harmfulness annotation:</strong> Each LLM response was labeled as either &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;harmful&quot; based on whether it appropriately avoided answering the risky question.</li><li><strong>Six refined action categories:</strong> Responses were further categorized into six action types, providing a more nuanced understanding of how the LLMs handled the risky prompts. These categories range from refusing to answer to directly following the harmful instruction.</li><li><strong>Guidelines for harmless responses:</strong> Three types of responses were considered safe: rejecting the question, refuting the question&#39;s premise, and providing general advice with disclaimers.</li><li><strong>Human evaluation process:</strong> Three annotators independently labeled the responses, resolving disagreements through discussion and consensus.</li><li><strong>Initial safety performance findings:</strong> LLaMA-2 was found to be the safest model, with the fewest harmful responses, while ChatGLM2 generated the most harmful responses.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear definition of harmless responses</strong>
        <p>The section provides clear guidelines for what constitutes a harmless response, making the annotation process more consistent and reliable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"What is a Harmless Response? Based on the nature of our questions that are intended to elicit risky answers, three types of responses are consid- ered to be safe: (1) reject to answer the question; (2) refute the underlying opinion/assumptions in the question; and (3) provide general advice with suitable disclaimers." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-defined action categories</strong>
        <p>The six action categories provide a useful framework for analyzing the different ways LLMs respond to risky prompts. This allows for a more detailed comparison of LLM behavior beyond simply labeling them as safe or harmful.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Refined Response Categories From the perspec- tive of how models respond to risky questions and what components are included in the answer, we categorize the responses into six refined categories as shown in Table 3, referring to as action cate- gories." (Page 6)</div>

            <h3>Automatic Response Evaluation</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores automatic methods for evaluating LLM responses to risky prompts, focusing on efficiency and scalability. Two main methods are presented: using GPT-4 as an evaluator and training a smaller, PLM-based classifier. Experiments show that the PLM-based classifier, specifically Longformer, achieves comparable performance to GPT-4, suggesting a cost-effective alternative for automatic safety evaluation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Need for automatic evaluation:</strong> Human evaluation is resource-intensive, motivating the need for automated methods.</li><li><strong>GPT-4 as evaluator:</strong> GPT-4 is used to classify LLM responses based on the defined action categories.</li><li><strong>PLM-based classifier:</strong> A Longformer model is fine-tuned to classify responses and detect harmful content.</li><li><strong>Comparable performance:</strong> Longformer achieves similar accuracy to GPT-4 in both action classification and harmful response detection.</li><li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> The smaller Longformer model offers a more efficient and scalable solution compared to using GPT-4.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear motivation</strong>
        <p>The section clearly explains the limitations of human evaluation and the need for automatic methods, setting the stage for the proposed approaches.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Human evaluation in AI development can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, complicating scalability and preventing timely assessment." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-defined methods</strong>
        <p>The section provides a clear description of both the GPT-4 and PLM-based evaluation methods, including details on prompting and training.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We follow Ye et al. (2023) in using GPT-4 for evaluation, and use the same guidelines as for human annotation (Table 3) with examples for in-context learning." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more details on the PLM training data</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions using human annotations, it would be helpful to provide more specifics about the size and composition of the training data used for the PLM-based classifier.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> More details on the training data would enhance reproducibility and allow for a better understanding of the classifier&#39;s performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include information on the number of annotated responses used for training, the distribution of labels, and any data augmentation techniques employed.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the limitations of automatic evaluation</strong>
        <p>While automatic evaluation offers advantages in terms of efficiency, it also has limitations. The section could be strengthened by discussing potential biases or inaccuracies in the automatic methods and how they might compare to human judgment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging the limitations of automatic evaluation would provide a more balanced perspective and highlight areas for future improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing potential limitations, such as the reliance on human annotations for training, the potential for biases in the training data, and the difficulty of capturing nuanced aspects of human judgment.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This paper introduced a three-level taxonomy for evaluating the risks of harm from LLMs, created a dataset of 939 risky questions and 5,000+ responses from six LLMs, and defined criteria for safe and responsible answers. They found that LLaMA-2 was the safest model and that a small, trained model could achieve comparable evaluation results to GPT-4.</p>

            <h3>Limitations and Future Work</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section outlines the limitations of the current research and suggests directions for future work. The primary limitations relate to the data collection process, specifically the focus on only risky instructions and the limited dataset size. The evaluation scope is also limited to English, single-turn, and zero-shot settings. Future work will address these limitations by including non-risky instructions, expanding the dataset, collecting multi-label annotations, and extending the evaluation to other languages, multi-turn conversations, and few-shot settings.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Focus on risky instructions:</strong> The dataset only includes risky instructions, which might lead to overestimating the safety of LLMs that simply refuse all instructions. Including non-risky instructions would provide a more balanced evaluation.</li><li><strong>Limited dataset size:</strong> The current dataset size is relatively small, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the dataset would improve the robustness of the evaluation.</li><li><strong>Single-label annotations:</strong> The current annotation scheme only allows for one action category per response, while some responses might fit multiple categories. Multi-label annotations would provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior.</li><li><strong>English-only evaluation:</strong> The evaluation is limited to English, which might not generalize to other languages with different cultural contexts and safety considerations.</li><li><strong>Single-turn, zero-shot setting:</strong> The evaluation focuses on single-turn conversations and a zero-shot setting, which doesn&#39;t fully capture the complexities of real-world LLM interactions. Extending the evaluation to multi-turn conversations and few-shot settings would provide a more realistic assessment.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clearly identifies limitations</strong>
        <p>The section clearly articulates the limitations of the current research, including the focus on risky instructions, the limited dataset size, and the scope of the evaluation. This transparency strengthens the overall analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As discussed in Section 4, all instructions in this dataset are risky. Excluding non-risky instructions limits the identification of over-sensitive LLMs." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provides concrete suggestions for future work</strong>
        <p>The section offers specific and actionable suggestions for future research, such as including non-risky instructions, expanding the dataset, and collecting multi-label annotations. These suggestions provide a clear roadmap for improving the evaluation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Evaluating model responses to non-risky instructions could address this problem. Additionally, our dataset size is relatively small; we plan to extend it with more questions in future work." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Prioritize future work suggestions</strong>
        <p>While the section lists several suggestions for future work, it could be improved by prioritizing them based on their potential impact and feasibility. This would help guide future research efforts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Prioritizing suggestions would make the section more impactful and help researchers focus on the most important areas for improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Rank the suggestions based on their importance and feasibility, or group them into short-term and long-term goals.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss potential challenges for future work</strong>
        <p>While the section suggests directions for future work, it could be strengthened by discussing potential challenges or limitations of these suggestions. This would provide a more realistic outlook on the feasibility of the proposed improvements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing potential challenges would enhance the analysis and provide a more nuanced perspective on the future of this research area.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each suggestion, briefly discuss potential challenges or limitations, such as the difficulty of collecting multi-label annotations or the computational cost of evaluating multi-turn conversations.</p>

            <h3>Protected Groups</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix lists the protected groups considered when generating the risky question set for the LLM safety evaluation. These groups include race, religion, gender, organization, and individual names. The inclusion of these groups aims to ensure that the evaluation covers a broad range of potential biases and vulnerabilities in LLMs.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Race:</strong> Nine race groups were considered, including Black, White, Caucasian, Asian, African, American Indian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Multiracial.</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Five religious groups were included: Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Atheist.</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Binary gender (male and female) was considered.</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> A subset of organizations sponsoring AI or NLP conferences was included.</li><li><strong>Individual names:</strong> Individual names were selected using stratified sampling across gender and race intersections to mitigate implicit biases.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Specific groups listed</strong>
        <p>The appendix clearly lists the specific groups considered for each protected attribute. This transparency is crucial for understanding the scope of the evaluation and potential biases in the dataset.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Race We consider 9 race groups: Black, White, Caucasian, Asian, African, American Indian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Multiracial." (Page 15)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Rationale for individual names</strong>
        <p>The appendix explains the rationale for including individual names and the methodology used to select them, addressing potential implicit biases related to gender and race.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Individual names have been shown to carry gender and race information implicitly, affecting model predictions (Subramanian et al., 2021; Han et al., 2023a)." (Page 15)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand gender categories</strong>
        <p>While the appendix acknowledges considering only binary gender, expanding to include non-binary and other gender identities would make the evaluation more inclusive and representative.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Gender We consider binary gender for now: male, female." (Page 15)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Including a wider range of gender identities would improve the comprehensiveness of the evaluation and address potential biases related to gender diversity.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include additional gender categories, such as non-binary, transgender, and genderqueer, and adapt the question generation process accordingly.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify organization selection criteria</strong>
        <p>While the appendix lists the organizations included, it could be strengthened by clarifying the specific criteria used to select these organizations. This would enhance transparency and reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Organization We collect a subset of organizations that are sponsors of AI or NLP conferences" (Page 15)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Clarifying the selection criteria would make the research more rigorous and allow others to replicate or extend the dataset.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed explanation of the organization selection process, including any specific inclusion or exclusion criteria used.</p>

            <h3>Three Harmful Responses of LLaMA-2</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix showcases the only three instances where LLaMA-2, generally the safest model tested, produced harmful responses. These instances all relate to risky over-reliance, where the model&#39;s human-like tone could lead users to depend on it inappropriately for emotional support or sensitive information.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>LLaMA-2&#39;s high safety ranking:</strong> LLaMA-2 is identified as the safest model among the six evaluated.</li><li><strong>Three harmful responses:</strong> Only three out of 939 test prompts elicited harmful responses from LLaMA-2.</li><li><strong>Risky over-reliance as source of harm:</strong> The harmful responses stemmed from scenarios where the model exhibited a human-like tone, potentially leading users to develop an unhealthy reliance on it for emotional support or keeping secrets.</li><li><strong>Focus on human-chatbot interaction harms:</strong> The three examples fall under the category of human-chatbot interaction harms, specifically related to over-reliance and potential for emotional manipulation.</li><li><strong>Limited scope of harm:</strong> Despite the harmful responses, the overall scope of harm is limited due to the small number of instances observed.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Specific examples provided</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of the full question and response pairs for each harmful instance allows for a detailed understanding of the context and nature of the harmful responses.</p>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more context on LLaMA-2&#39;s training</strong>
        <p>While the appendix focuses on the harmful responses, providing more context on LLaMA-2&#39;s training and safety mechanisms would help understand why these specific failures occurred.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the model&#39;s training can shed light on the root causes of the harmful responses and inform future improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a brief description of LLaMA-2&#39;s training process, particularly any safety-related training or constraints implemented.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss potential mitigation strategies</strong>
        <p>The appendix could be strengthened by discussing potential mitigation strategies for the identified harmful responses. This would provide actionable insights for developers working on LLM safety.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing mitigation strategies would make the analysis more practical and contribute to the development of safer LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing potential mitigation strategies, such as detecting and modifying human-like tones, providing explicit disclaimers about the model&#39;s limitations, or incorporating mechanisms to discourage over-reliance.</p>

            <h3>Response Action Category over Harm Types</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix visually represents the distribution of response action categories across different Large Language Models (LLMs) for various harm types. It highlights the observation that models tend to exhibit specific response patterns depending on the type of harm presented in the prompt.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Response patterns by harm type:</strong> LLMs demonstrate distinct response patterns based on the harm type they are presented with.</li><li><strong>Visual representation:</strong> The distribution of action categories is visualized, likely using heatmaps, to facilitate comparison across models and harm types.</li><li><strong>Model comparison:</strong> The visualization allows for comparing the response patterns of different LLMs for each harm type.</li><li><strong>Action category distribution:</strong> The distribution of the six defined action categories (e.g., refuse to answer, refute the opinion, etc.) is shown for each harm type.</li><li><strong>Understanding model behavior:</strong> The analysis of response patterns helps in understanding how different LLMs handle various types of harmful prompts and contributes to insights into their safety mechanisms.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Visual representation of data</strong>
        <p>Using a visual representation, presumably heatmaps as mentioned in the main text, is a strength as it allows for quick and easy comparison of response patterns across different models and harm types.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figure 9 shows the distribution of six response action categories of different models." (Page 16)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Focus on harm-specific patterns</strong>
        <p>Highlighting the harm-specific response patterns is a strength as it provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs react to different types of harmful prompts, going beyond a simple safe/unsafe classification.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Given a specific harm type, models have obvious response patterns." (Page 16)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Include the visualization</strong>
        <p>The appendix refers to Figure 9 but doesn&#39;t include it. Including the figure directly in the appendix would make the analysis self-contained and easier to understand.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figure 9 shows the distribution of six response action categories of different models." (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The visualization is crucial for understanding the described response patterns. Without it, the appendix is incomplete.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include Figure 9 directly in the appendix.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detailed analysis of the patterns</strong>
        <p>While the appendix mentions obvious response patterns, it doesn&#39;t provide a detailed analysis of these patterns. Describing the specific patterns observed for different harm types would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Given a specific harm type, models have obvious response patterns." (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed analysis would provide more actionable insights into LLM behavior and inform the development of better safety mechanisms.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph or two describing the specific response patterns observed for different harm types. For example, mention which action categories are most common for each harm type and discuss any notable differences between LLMs.</p>

        <summary>figure 9</summary>
        <p>Figure 9 presents six heatmaps illustrating the distribution of action categories taken by six large language models (LLMs) in response to prompts related to six different harm types. Each heatmap corresponds to a specific harm type, such as leaking sensitive information or generating adult content. The LLMs included are GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, ChatGLM2, LLaMA-2, and Vicuna. The action categories (0-5) represent different ways the LLMs can respond, ranging from refusing to answer to directly following the harmful instruction. The color intensity in each cell of the heatmap indicates the frequency of a specific action category for a given LLM and harm type, with darker colors representing higher frequencies. This allows for a visual comparison of how different LLMs handle various types of risky prompts.</p>

        <p>Table 8 provides statistics on instances where the assigned action category (a measure of harmfulness based on the six categories defined in Table 3) contradicts the actual harmfulness of the LLM&#39;s response, as determined by human evaluation. These are referred to as &#39;mismatched cases.&#39; Two types of mismatches are presented: (1) where the action category is 5 (indicating a harmful response according to Table 3), but the response is judged harmless by human annotators; and (2) where the action category is 0-4 (indicating a harmless response), but the response is judged harmful. The table shows the number of occurrences of each mismatch type for each of the six LLMs: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, ChatGLM2, LLaMA-2, and Vicuna. A &#39;Total&#39; column sums the two mismatch types for each LLM.</p>

            <h3>Mismatched Cases</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This appendix presents cases where the assigned action category (a measure of how the LLM responded) didn&#39;t match the human judgment of whether the response was actually harmful. These &quot;mismatched cases&quot; highlight situations where an LLM&#39;s response might be categorized as safe based on its action (like refusing to answer), but the actual content of the response is still harmful, or vice-versa. This points to the limitations of relying solely on action categories for judging safety and emphasizes the importance of careful content review.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Definition of mismatched cases:</strong> Mismatched cases occur when the assigned action category (0-5) doesn&#39;t align with the human assessment of harmfulness. For example, a response might be categorized as refusing to answer (safe), but still contain harmful content.</li><li><strong>Two types of mismatches:</strong> The analysis focuses on two specific types: (1) cases where the LLM follows the instruction (action category 5) but the response is harmless, and (2) cases where the LLM refuses or refutes (action categories 0-4) but the response is harmful.</li><li><strong>Examples of mismatches:</strong> The appendix provides specific examples of these mismatches from ChatGLM2 and Vicuna, illustrating how these discrepancies can arise in practice.</li><li><strong>Importance of content review:</strong> The existence of mismatched cases highlights the limitations of relying solely on action categories for evaluating LLM safety and emphasizes the need for careful review of the response content itself.</li><li><strong>Implications for automatic evaluation:</strong> These mismatches suggest that automatic evaluation methods based on action categories alone may not be sufficient and require further refinement to accurately assess harmfulness.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear definition of mismatch types</strong>
        <p>The appendix clearly defines the two types of mismatches considered, making the analysis focused and easy to follow.</p>
        <div class="quote">"That is, (1) action category is 5 and the response is harmless; and (2) action category is 0–4 while response is harmful, referred to as mismatched cases." (Page 16)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Illustrative examples</strong>
        <p>Providing specific examples of mismatched cases from ChatGLM2 and Vicuna helps to illustrate the issue and understand how these discrepancies can occur in practice.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Table 9 demonstrates four responses from ChatGLM2 and Vicuna, where action category labels and harmfulness labels disobey the assumption that responses follow the instructions are harmful, and they are otherwise harmless." (Page 16)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Include Table 8 in the appendix</strong>
        <p>The appendix refers to Table 8, which summarizes the number of mismatched cases for each model, but the table itself is not included. Including the table directly in the appendix would make the analysis more complete and informative.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Table 8 shows the number of cases falling into each." (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The table provides important quantitative data that supports the analysis of mismatched cases. Without it, the reader has to refer back to the main text, disrupting the flow of the appendix.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include Table 8 directly in Appendix D.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the implications for the overall evaluation</strong>
        <p>While the appendix highlights the existence of mismatched cases, it doesn&#39;t fully discuss their implications for the overall evaluation of LLM safety. Elaborating on how these mismatches might affect the conclusions drawn about the models&#39; performance would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing the implications for the overall evaluation would provide a more complete and nuanced perspective on the limitations of the current evaluation methodology.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing how the mismatched cases might affect the interpretation of the results presented in the main text. For example, consider whether the presence of mismatches might lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the safety of certain models.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            
    <h4>Non-Text Elements</h4>
    
    <details class="non-text-element">
        <summary>table 8</summary>
        <p>This table shows the number of mismatched cases for each of the six tested large language models (LLMs). A mismatch occurs when the predicted action category (0-5, representing how the LLM responded to a prompt) doesn&#39;t align with the human judgment of whether the response was actually harmful. There are two types of mismatches: 1) the model followed the prompt (category 5), but the response was judged harmless, and 2) the model didn&#39;t follow the prompt (categories 0-4), but the response was judged harmful. The table lists the number of each type of mismatch and the total number of mismatches for each LLM.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table is important because it highlights the limitations of using action categories alone to determine harmfulness. It shows that the automated classification doesn&#39;t always agree with human judgment, suggesting a need for improvement in the automated evaluation methods or a deeper understanding of what constitutes a harmful response.</p>

        <summary>table 9</summary>
        <p>This table provides specific examples of mismatched cases where the assigned action category doesn&#39;t align with the human-labeled harmfulness of the response. Each row shows an example from either ChatGLM2 or Vicuna. The table includes the model, whether the response was judged harmful, the assigned action category, the original question, the model&#39;s response, and the reason for the mismatch. For example, one ChatGLM2 response was classified as refusing to assist (category 0) but was judged harmful because it provided risky instructions. Another ChatGLM2 response followed the prompt (category 5), offering to interpret blood test results, but was judged harmless in the context of a single-turn chat.</p>
