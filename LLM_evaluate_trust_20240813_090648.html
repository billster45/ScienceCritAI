                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This research paper addresses the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a new self-detection paradigm called &quot;Think Twice Before Trusting&quot; (T3) to mitigate over-trust in incorrect LLM-generated answers. The T3 framework considers a broader answer space, prompting the LLM to reflect on and justify multiple candidate answers before calibrating confidence in the target answer. Extensive experiments across various tasks and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving self-detection and reducing over-trust.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The T3 framework consistently outperforms existing self-detection methods in terms of AUROC, PRAUC, and ECE across various datasets and tasks, including Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Inference, and Commonsense Question Answering.</li><li>Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component of the T3 framework, including reflection and justification, joint confidence calibration, and order shuffling of justifications.</li><li>T3 demonstrates robustness across different target answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5, GLM-4, Gemini), and parameter settings, indicating its generalizability and flexibility.</li><li>The T3 framework shows potential for selective prediction scenarios, where abstaining from answers with low detection scores leads to improved accuracy on the remaining instances.</li><li>Case studies illustrate how T3 helps LLMs identify and reduce over-trust in incorrect answers by considering justifications from different answer perspectives and reflecting uncertainty when appropriate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The paper clearly identifies the over-trust issue in LLM self-detection and proposes a novel paradigm to address it, considering a broader answer space and leveraging LLM&#x27;s reflection and justification capabilities.</li><li>The proposed T3 framework is well-defined, with clear steps and justifications for its design choices. The framework is also flexible and can be integrated with existing self-detection methods.</li><li>The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering various tasks, datasets, and LLMs. The inclusion of ablation studies and robustness analysis further strengthens the validity of the findings.</li><li>The paper provides detailed implementation details, including prompts and hyperparameters, facilitating reproducibility and future research.</li><li>The paper acknowledges limitations and ethical considerations, promoting transparency and responsible development of LLM self-detection techniques.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the paper focuses on black-box API LLMs, exploring the applicability of the T3 framework to white-box LLMs could broaden its impact and address potential limitations.</li><li>Further investigation into the practical utility of self-detection for enhancing task accuracy and enabling LLM self-correction would strengthen the practical implications of the research.</li><li>A more in-depth analysis of the generated justifications, including potential biases and limitations, would provide a deeper understanding of the LLM&#x27;s reasoning process and inform future improvements.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Introduction section emphasizes the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), where LLMs generate incorrect or nonsensical outputs. It highlights self-detection as a promising approach to evaluate output trustability and identify incorrect outputs. The focus is on black-box API LLMs due to their performance and the challenges posed by limited output information. The section briefly introduces two existing self-detection paradigms: confidence calibration and self-evaluation. However, it points out a significant drawback of both paradigms: a tendency to over-trust incorrect LLM-generated answers. The section argues that this over-trust stems from evaluating only LLM-generated answers, neglecting a broader answer space. It proposes a new paradigm that considers a comprehensive answer space beyond LLM generations to mitigate this over-trust issue.</p>

The second one is self-evaluation, which directly examines the compatibility of question and answer by designing various prompt strategies (Miao et al., 2023; Kadavath et al., 2022; Weng et al., 2023).'<span class='page-number'>p. 1</span></blockquote>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 1, titled &quot;An illustration of Think Twice before Trusting framework for mitigating the over-trust issue in LLM self-detection,&quot; is a flow chart that illustrates the proposed &quot;Think Twice Before Trusting&quot; framework. It visually depicts the process of mitigating over-trust in LLM self-detection. The figure starts with a user asking a question: &quot;How do you repair a torn shirt?&quot; Two potential answers are then generated, one incorrect (prepare the needle and thread...) with an accuracy of 0 and a detection score of 0.7, and one correct (Flip the shirt inside-out...). For each answer, the framework prompts the LLM to generate a justification. The justifications are then used to calibrate the confidence in the target answer, resulting in a lower confidence score for the incorrect answer (30%) and a higher score for the correct answer. The figure aims to highlight the importance of generating and considering multiple answers and justifications before trusting an LLM&#x27;s self-detection capabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 1 is relevant to the Introduction as it visually introduces the proposed &quot;Think Twice Before Trusting&quot; framework, which is the core contribution of the paper. It provides a clear and concise overview of the framework&#x27;s process, emphasizing the key steps of reflection, justification, and confidence calibration. This visual representation helps readers understand the proposed solution to the over-trust issue discussed in the Introduction.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Problem Formulation section formally defines the task of self-detection for Large Language Models (LLMs). It explains that given a question (q) and a prompt (p), the LLM generates an answer (a), referred to as the target answer. Self-detection then aims to evaluate the trustability of this target answer using the LLM&#x27;s own capabilities, typically producing a detection score (c). The section further elaborates on two existing paradigms for self-detection: Confidence Calibration and Self-Evaluation. Confidence Calibration focuses on estimating the LLM&#x27;s confidence in the generated answer, aligning it with the actual answer accuracy. This involves sampling multiple answers and aggregating their probabilities. Self-Evaluation, on the other hand, directly examines the compatibility between the question and the generated answer using various prompt strategies. However, the section highlights a significant limitation of both paradigms: a tendency to over-trust incorrect LLM-generated answers. This over-trust stems from evaluating only the LLM-generated answers, neglecting a broader answer space. The section concludes by proposing a new paradigm, Comprehensive Answer Evaluation, which considers multiple candidate answers within the answer space to mitigate this over-trust issue. This paradigm involves evaluating the trustability of each question-answer pair and aggregating these evaluations to enhance self-detection of the target answer.</p>

            <h2>Think Twice Before Assure Framework</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>This section introduces the &quot;Think Twice Before Trusting&quot; (T3) framework, designed to address the over-trust issue in LLM self-detection. It highlights two key considerations for implementing the proposed comprehensive answer evaluation paradigm: resisting LLM&#x27;s inherent bias to accurately evaluate each question-answer pair and effectively aggregating these evaluations for the target answer&#x27;s self-detection. The framework consists of two steps: 1) Reflection and Justification: The LLM is instructed to reflect on the trustability of each candidate answer and provide justifications for its potential correctness. This step aims to mitigate LLM&#x27;s bias by forcing it to seek evidence supporting the rationality of each answer. 2) Joint Confidence Calibration: After obtaining justifications for each answer, the framework integrates them with a confidence calibration method, specifically the Top-K verbalized method. This involves generating a set of potential answers and their probabilities, considering the provided justifications. The section emphasizes that the T3 framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches, such as prompt ensemble and Hybrid methods, for superior self-detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Table 1, titled &quot;Prompts used in our T3 framework,&quot; presents two prompts: pe and pv. The pe prompt instructs the LLM to reflect on a given answer choice (aqi) for a question (q) and generate an explanation to justify the answer judgment. The pv prompt instructs the LLM to provide its N best guesses and their probabilities for a question (q), given a set of answer choices (aq1,..., aqN) and possible explanations (e1,..., en) for each answer. The table aims to showcase the specific prompt structures used in the T3 framework for reflection and justification (pe) and joint confidence calibration (pv).</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Table 1 is highly relevant to the &quot;Think Twice Before Assure Framework&quot; section as it provides the concrete prompts used in the two steps of the T3 framework. It directly supports the explanation of the Reflection and Justification step by presenting the pe prompt, which instructs the LLM to generate justifications. Similarly, it supports the Joint Confidence Calibration step by presenting the pv prompt, which integrates the generated justifications for confidence estimation.</p>

            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Table</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Type:</strong> Table</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Table 3, titled &quot;Ablation studies,&quot; presents the results of ablation experiments conducted to evaluate the impact of different components of the T3 framework on its performance. The table lists four variations of T3: the original T3, &quot;w/ CoT expl&quot; (substituting justifications with CoT reasoning), &quot;sep expl&quot; (placing each justification in a separate prompt), and &quot;w/o shuffle&quot; (removing order shuffling of justifications). The table shows the AUROC and PRAUC scores for each variation across six datasets (IMDB, Flipkart, SNLI, HANS, CommonsenseQA, PIQA). The results demonstrate that removing or altering key components of T3 generally leads to a decrease in performance, supporting the design choices of the framework.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Table 3 is highly relevant to the Experiments section as it provides evidence for the effectiveness of the specific design choices made in the T3 framework. It directly supports the claims made about the importance of reflection and justification, joint confidence calibration, and order shuffling by showing that removing or altering these components negatively impacts performance.</p>

            <h4>Figure 6</h4>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Figure</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Type:</strong> Line Graph</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 6, titled &quot;Parameter sensitivity, i.e., changing the number of justifications and number of guesses in pv,&quot; presents two line graphs, each representing the impact of varying the number of justifications and guesses in the pv prompt on the performance of T3. The left graph shows the AUROC scores on the SNLI dataset, while the right graph shows the accuracy on the CommonsenseQA dataset. The x-axis of both graphs represents the number of justifications or guesses, and the y-axis represents the performance metric (AUROC or accuracy). The figure aims to demonstrate the sensitivity of T3&#x27;s performance to these parameters.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 6 is relevant to the Experiments section as it explores the parameter sensitivity of the T3 framework. It provides insights into the impact of varying the number of justifications and guesses on T3&#x27;s performance, helping to understand the optimal parameter settings for different tasks.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Conclusion section summarizes the paper&#x27;s key contributions in addressing the over-trust issue in self-detection for black-box API LLMs. It reiterates the limitations of existing self-detection paradigms that focus solely on LLM-generated answers, leading to over-trust in incorrect outputs. The section highlights the proposed comprehensive answer evaluation paradigm, which considers a broader answer space and compares the trustability of multiple candidate answers. It emphasizes the effectiveness of the &quot;Think Twice Before Trusting&quot; (T3) framework in implementing this paradigm by instructing the LLM to reflect on and justify each candidate answer before calibrating confidence. The section concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the current work, particularly its focus on black-box API LLMs and the need for further exploration of self-detection&#x27;s utility in enhancing task accuracy and enabling self-correction. It also suggests future research directions, including combining T3 with more methods and exploring its applicability to white-box LLMs.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Appendix C focuses on evaluating the prompt sensitivity of the pe and pv prompts used in the T3 framework. It examines the impact of rephrasing these prompts on the framework&#x27;s performance, specifically in terms of AUROC scores. The analysis involves rephrasing each prompt three times using ChatGPT and calculating the average and standard deviation of AUROC scores across these variations. The results suggest that while prompt rephrasing has a mild effect on T3&#x27;s performance, the HANS dataset exhibits higher sensitivity compared to Flipkart and PIQA. Additionally, the analysis indicates that changes in the pe prompt have a larger impact on detection performance than changes in the pv prompt, potentially due to the wider range of variations in justifications generated by pe compared to the outputs of pv.</p>

                <p>Appendix D presents a performance comparison of the T3 framework on the Gemini language model using three datasets: Flipkart, PIQA, and CommonsenseQA. The results, presented in Table 9, show that while T3 performs well on PIQA and CommonsenseQA, it doesn&#x27;t outperform all compared methods on Flipkart. The appendix attributes this discrepancy to Gemini&#x27;s tendency to prioritize answer prediction over following the instructions for reflection and justification. It concludes that the effectiveness of T3 depends on the LLM&#x27;s ability to adhere to the instructions for generating justifications from different answer perspectives.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Appendix E presents two case studies from the PIQA dataset to illustrate the effectiveness of the T3 framework in mitigating over-trust in LLM self-detection. The first case study involves a question about repairing a torn shirt, where the LLM initially assigns a high confidence score (0.7) to an incorrect answer. However, after applying T3 and generating justifications for both answer choices, the detection score for the incorrect answer is lowered to 0.45. The second case study focuses on a question about keeping a couch fur-free, where the LLM initially exhibits high confidence (0.7) in an incorrect answer. After applying T3, the detection score is adjusted to 0.5, reflecting the LLM&#x27;s uncertainty about the correct answer. These case studies demonstrate how T3 can help LLMs identify and reduce over-trust in incorrect answers by considering justifications from different answer perspectives.</p>

The case study involves a question about repairing a torn shirt with two answer choices: (a) a simple explanation and (b) a more detailed explanation including flipping the shirt inside-out. The LLM initially predicts answer (a) with a confidence score of 0.7 using the Top-K Verb method. However, after generating justifications for both answers and applying T3, the detection score for (a) is lowered to 0.45. The table shows the justifications for each answer, the pv outputs with different justification orders, and the final T3 detection score.

            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Table</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Type:</strong> Table</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Table 11, titled &quot;Case study for PIQA. pv output 1 refers to pv with justification (a) before justification (b), and pv output 2 refers to the reversed order,&quot; presents another case study from the PIQA dataset, focusing on a question about keeping a couch fur-free. The LLM initially predicts answer (b), which involves dampening a sponge, with a confidence score of 0.7 using the Top-K Verb method. However, the ground truth answer is (a), using a dry sponge. After generating justifications for both answers and applying T3, the detection score for (b) is adjusted to 0.5. The table shows the justifications for each answer, the pv outputs with different justification orders, and the final T3 detection score. The justifications highlight the potential benefits and drawbacks of both dampening and not dampening the sponge, reflecting the LLM&#x27;s uncertainty about the definitive best approach.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Table 11 is relevant to Appendix E as it provides an additional case study demonstrating T3&#x27;s ability to handle situations where the LLM is uncertain about the correct answer. It shows how T3 can lead to a more balanced confidence score, reflecting the ambiguity present in the justifications for both answer choices.</p>
