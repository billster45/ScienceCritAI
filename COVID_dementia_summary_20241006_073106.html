        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This systematic review investigates the parallel electrophysiological abnormalities detected by electroencephalography (EEG) in individuals with Long COVID and Alzheimer&#39;s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The review found that COVID-19 patients, even months after the initial infection, frequently display abnormal EEG activity, including a slowing of brain waves and epileptiform activity, similar to patterns observed in early ADRD. These shared EEG abnormalities suggest potential overlapping pathologies, such as neuroinflammation, astrocyte reactivity, hypoxia, and neurovascular injury. The review proposes that routine EEG could be a valuable tool for monitoring COVID-19 patients, predicting long-term outcomes, and assessing treatment effectiveness, offering insights into the shared mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for both Long COVID and ADRD. The analysis included keyword searches across multiple databases, expert panel review, and consideration of co-authors&#39; research and expert communications.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Generalized slowing of brain activity, particularly in the frontal regions, is a common EEG finding in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID. This slowing is characterized by increased delta and theta power and decreased alpha power, mirroring EEG changes seen in early ADRD. This suggests a potential disruption of normal brain function and could contribute to cognitive symptoms like &quot;brain fog.&quot; The slowing was measured by analyzing EEG recordings and quantifying the power in different frequency bands. The implications of this finding are that EEG could be used as a potential biomarker for identifying and monitoring neurological complications in COVID-19 patients.</li><li>More severe EEG alterations, such as epileptiform activity and alpha coma, are observed in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing conditions like epilepsy or cognitive impairment. This suggests a heightened vulnerability to neurological complications in these individuals. These severe EEG patterns were identified through visual inspection and analysis of EEG recordings. The implication is that patients with pre-existing neurological conditions should be closely monitored for neurological complications following COVID-19 infection.</li><li>Long COVID patients exhibit persistent EEG abnormalities, including reduced posterior alpha dominance and increased delta/theta activity, often with hemispheric asymmetries. These persistent changes suggest long-lasting effects of COVID-19 on brain function and could be related to ongoing cognitive difficulties. These EEG abnormalities were observed in studies that followed COVID-19 patients for several months after the initial infection. This highlights the need for long-term neurological follow-up and potential interventions for Long COVID patients.</li><li>The EEG abnormalities observed in Long COVID resemble those seen in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD, suggesting shared neurophysiological mechanisms. This parallel could indicate a potential increased risk of developing ADRD in individuals with Long COVID. This similarity was established by comparing EEG patterns in Long COVID patients with those in individuals diagnosed with MCI and ADRD. This finding warrants further investigation into the long-term cognitive consequences of COVID-19 and potential preventative strategies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The review employed a comprehensive search strategy, utilizing multiple databases and specific keywords, to identify relevant literature on COVID-19 and EEG. This thorough approach ensures a wide coverage of the existing research and minimizes the risk of missing important studies. The use of multiple databases strengthens the reliability of the findings.</li><li>The involvement of an expert panel, specializing in both ADRD and COVID-19, ensured the quality and rigor of the review process. The expertise of the panel members enhances the credibility of the review and its conclusions. The panel&#39;s diverse expertise in neurophysiology, astrocyte reactivity, and neuroinflammation broadened the scope of the review.</li><li>The review clearly describes the neurological and cognitive symptoms associated with Long COVID, providing a comprehensive overview of the clinical manifestations of the disease. This detailed description helps readers understand the diverse ways in which Long COVID can affect patients. The use of statistics from multiple studies strengthens the evidence base for the prevalence of these symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>While the review suggests a potential link between COVID-19 and amyloid/tau pathologies, the evidence presented is largely based on parallels with ADRD research. Future research should directly investigate the presence and role of amyloid/tau pathology in Long COVID patients to strengthen this link. This could involve post-mortem brain studies or the use of biomarkers for amyloid/tau in living patients. This would provide more conclusive evidence for this potential connection.</li><li>The review mentions the potential of EEG as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in Long COVID, but it would be beneficial to discuss its limitations more explicitly. EEG has limited spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques like MRI, and EEG findings can be non-specific, meaning similar patterns can be seen in different conditions. Addressing these limitations would provide a more balanced perspective and guide future research to refine the use of EEG in this context.</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This review highlights the potential of EEG as a valuable tool for understanding and managing the neurological complications of Long COVID. The findings suggest that Long COVID and ADRD share similar neurophysiological abnormalities, detectable through routine EEG, potentially stemming from overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, astrocyte reactivity, and synaptic dysfunction. Future research should focus on validating EEG as a biomarker for Long COVID severity and cognitive decline risk, investigating the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19, and exploring potential therapeutic interventions targeting shared mechanisms with ADRD. Further research is crucial to determine the specificity of EEG abnormalities in Long COVID compared to other conditions, to establish standardized EEG protocols for Long COVID assessment, and to explore the impact of diverse demographic factors on EEG findings. This will pave the way for personalized medicine approaches and targeted interventions for individuals with Long COVID.</p>

            <h3>Methodology of the Review</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section outlines the methodology employed for the systematic review. The review focused on EEG signatures of Long COVID, comparing them with existing literature on Alzheimer&#39;s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The researchers used a multi-pronged approach, starting with keyword searches across various databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, NIH, and CDC. They refined their search by setting specific criteria for EEG signatures in Long COVID, ensuring relevance to EEG studies in COVID-19 positive individuals. The expert panel, comprised of electrophysiology professionals, was further enhanced by inviting specialists in neurophysiology, astrocyte reactivity, and neuroinflammation. The review process also incorporated co-authors&#39; research, publication recommendations, and expert communications. Finally, the authors acknowledge two caveats: the broad diagnostic criteria for Long COVID brain fog and the heterogeneity of EEG data analysis procedures across studies.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>

            <h3>EEG Studies in COVID-19 Patients</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores EEG findings in COVID-19 patients, both during the acute phase of infection and in Long COVID. It notes that common EEG abnormalities include a generalized slowing of brain activity, particularly in the frontal regions, often manifesting as increased delta and theta power and decreased alpha power. More severe EEG alterations are observed in patients with pre-existing conditions like epilepsy or cognitive impairment. The section also discusses Alpha Coma (AC), a specific EEG pattern seen in some severe acute COVID-19 cases, and highlights the potential of EEG abnormalities as biomarkers for brain damage.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Generalized Slowing:</strong> A common EEG finding in acute COVID-19 is a generalized slowing of brain activity, especially in frontal regions.</li><li><strong>Correlation with Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> More severe EEG abnormalities are seen in patients with prior neurological conditions like epilepsy or cognitive impairment.</li><li><strong>Alpha Coma:</strong> AC, a distinct EEG pattern indicating a state of clinical coma, is observed in some severe acute COVID-19 cases.</li><li><strong>Potential Biomarker:</strong> EEG abnormalities, especially those specific to the frontal lobe, may serve as a biomarker for potential brain damage persisting after acute infection.</li><li><strong>Long COVID EEG Findings:</strong> Long COVID patients also exhibit EEG abnormalities, including reduced posterior alpha dominance and increased delta/theta activity, sometimes with hemispheric asymmetries.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive overview of EEG findings</strong>
        <p>The section provides a good overview of the different EEG abnormalities observed in both acute and Long COVID, including generalized slowing, epileptiform activity, and alpha coma.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Several studies discussed characteristics of abnormal rsEEG activity recorded in COVID-19 patients ranging from acute individual case reports47 to larger longitudinal studies.48" (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Focus on clinical relevance</strong>
        <p>The section emphasizes the potential clinical significance of EEG abnormalities as biomarkers for brain damage and for monitoring disease progression.</p>
        <div class="quote">"EEG abnormalities seen in COVID-19 individuals could indicate potential brain damage that may persist after acute infection." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detail on Long COVID EEG findings</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions Long COVID EEG abnormalities, it would be beneficial to expand on this aspect, providing more specific details about the types and prevalence of EEG changes observed in Long COVID patients.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In the following paragraphs, we compare the EEG activity recorded during and months after COVID-19." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more complete picture of the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include more details from the studies cited in Table 2, such as specific frequency band changes, topographic distribution of abnormalities, and the correlation with cognitive symptoms.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the limitations of EEG as a diagnostic tool</strong>
        <p>While EEG can provide valuable information, it&#39;s important to acknowledge its limitations in diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19. The section could benefit from a brief discussion of these limitations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more balanced perspective on the role of EEG in COVID-19.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the limitations of EEG, such as its limited spatial resolution and the potential for non-specific findings. Mention the need for further research to validate the use of EEG as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in COVID-19.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the relationship between EEG slowing and cognitive impairment</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the association between EEG slowing and cognitive impairment, but it would be helpful to clarify this relationship further. Is EEG slowing a direct cause of cognitive impairment, a consequence of it, or simply a marker of underlying brain dysfunction?</p>
        <div class="quote">"Acute COVID-19 causes characteristic rsEEG patterns (Table 1) with a generalized “slowing” in the rsEEG activity.39,48,54,55" (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the potential causal relationships between EEG slowing and cognitive impairment, citing relevant research and exploring different hypotheses.</p>

        <p>Table 1 summarizes acute COVID-19 EEG studies. It lists authors, study types, affected brain sites, neurological abnormalities, EEG findings, and EEG markers. Each row represents a different study. For example, Antony and Haneef (2020) conducted a literature review of 617 patients, finding diffuse slowing (68%), focal slowing (17%), and other abnormalities, with frontal epileptiform discharges and frontal monomorphic biphasic slow waves as EEG markers. Other studies listed provide similar data, showing EEG slowing, epileptiform activity, and other abnormalities in acute COVID-19.</p>

            <h3>EEG Slowing in COVID-19</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores the potential reasons behind the EEG slowing observed in COVID-19 patients, drawing parallels with similar patterns seen in Alzheimer&#39;s disease and related dementias (ADRD). It discusses how amyloid and tau pathologies, often associated with ADRD, might be linked to COVID-19 and contribute to the observed EEG slowing. Additionally, the section investigates the role of hypoxia, heart rate variability (HRV), and their connection to abnormal EEG activity in Long COVID. It suggests that hypoxia, resulting from various factors including respiratory issues and heart-brain connection abnormalities, can lead to EEG slowing and cognitive symptoms like brain fog. The section also touches upon the EEG pattern of burst suppression, seen in some slow-recovering COVID-19 patients, and its association with reduced brain metabolism.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Amyloid and Tau Pathologies:</strong> The section explores the potential link between COVID-19 and amyloid and tau pathologies, which are characteristic of ADRD and could contribute to EEG slowing.</li><li><strong>Hypoxia and its Mechanisms:</strong> It discusses how hypoxia, arising from respiratory problems, heart-brain connection abnormalities, and other factors, can lead to EEG slowing in COVID-19.</li><li><strong>Heart Rate Variability:</strong> The section examines the role of HRV in COVID-19, suggesting that changes in HRV could indicate autonomic dysfunction and contribute to hypoxia and cognitive symptoms.</li><li><strong>Burst Suppression:</strong> It describes the burst suppression EEG pattern observed in some COVID-19 patients and its association with reduced brain metabolism.</li><li><strong>Overlap with Sleep Apnea:</strong> The section notes that EEG patterns in COVID-19 patients with hypoxia may resemble those seen in sleep apnea, suggesting potential shared mechanisms.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Exploration of multiple mechanisms</strong>
        <p>The section explores several potential mechanisms contributing to EEG slowing in COVID-19, providing a comprehensive perspective.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It is not entirely clear how COVID-19 contributes to a shift to lower frequencies in the rsEEG activity, parallel to that observed in ADRD patients.65" (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connecting COVID-19 with ADRD research</strong>
        <p>The section effectively connects the findings in COVID-19 research with existing knowledge about ADRD, highlighting potential shared pathways and mechanisms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Linking these effects to the abnormal rsEEG activity seen in Long COVID patients, it can be speculated that similar accumulation of amyloid and tau may co-occur with the neuroinflammatory, autoimmune, hypoxia, and cerebrovascular alterations that are often observed in ADRD patients.67" (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the evidence for amyloid/tau link</strong>
        <p>While the section suggests a potential link between COVID-19 and amyloid/tau pathologies, the evidence presented is somewhat speculative. Strengthening this link with more direct evidence would be beneficial.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would make the argument more convincing and highlight the potential implications for understanding both COVID-19 and ADRD.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide more direct evidence from studies that have investigated amyloid/tau pathology in COVID-19 patients, if available. If direct evidence is limited, clearly acknowledge the speculative nature of this link and suggest future research directions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the relationship between HRV, hypoxia, and EEG</strong>
        <p>The section mentions HRV and hypoxia as potential factors in EEG slowing, but the relationship between these factors could be clarified further. How exactly does altered HRV contribute to hypoxia and EEG changes?</p>
        <div class="quote">"Hypoxia could result from abnormal heart-brain connections as well." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more mechanistic understanding of the interplay between these factors.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed explanation of the physiological mechanisms linking HRV, hypoxia, and EEG changes. For example, explain how reduced HRV can lead to decreased cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, resulting in hypoxia and subsequent EEG slowing.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the clinical implications</strong>
        <p>The section could be strengthened by discussing the clinical implications of the findings. How can this knowledge about EEG slowing and its underlying mechanisms be used to improve the diagnosis, treatment, or management of Long COVID?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would enhance the practical relevance of the research and highlight its potential impact on patient care.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the clinical implications, such as the potential use of EEG as a biomarker for Long COVID or for monitoring treatment response. Suggest future research directions that could translate these findings into clinical applications.</p>

            <h3>Possible Neurophysiological Abnormalities in Long COVID: Parallel to ADRD</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores the potential neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the neurological and cognitive symptoms observed in Long COVID, drawing parallels with Alzheimer&#39;s disease and related dementias (ADRD). It focuses on the role of neuroinflammation, chronic glial reactivity, and cerebrovascular injury in both conditions. The section discusses how these factors can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal abnormalities, which are reflected in abnormal EEG patterns. It also highlights the role of complement C3 and glutamate transport dysfunction in synapse loss and impaired brain function, suggesting similar mechanisms might be at play in both Long COVID and ADRD.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Neuroinflammation and Glial Reactivity:</strong> The section emphasizes the role of neuroinflammation and chronic glial reactivity, particularly astrocyte reactivity, as key drivers of neuronal abnormalities in both Long COVID and ADRD.</li><li><strong>Synaptic Dysfunction:</strong> It highlights how neuroinflammation and glial reactivity can lead to synaptic dysfunction, which is reflected in abnormal EEG patterns.</li><li><strong>Complement C3 and Synapse Loss:</strong> The section discusses the role of complement C3, released by reactive astrocytes, in synapse elimination and dysfunction, drawing parallels with its role in AD.</li><li><strong>Glutamate Transport Dysfunction:</strong> It explains how the loss of glutamate transport function in reactive astrocytes contributes to synaptic hyperexcitability and neuronal damage.</li><li><strong>Cerebrovascular Injury:</strong> The section also touches upon the role of cerebrovascular injury and atrophy in both Long COVID and ADRD, linking them to abnormal EEG activity.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear explanation of complex mechanisms</strong>
        <p>The section effectively explains the complex interplay between neuroinflammation, glial reactivity, synaptic dysfunction, and EEG abnormalities in a clear and accessible manner.</p>
        <div class="quote">"One of the most likely mechanisms of COVID-19 neuroinvasion explaining the “slowing” of rsEEG activity is the inflammatory response to the SARS-COVID-19 virus, leading to cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connecting Long COVID with ADRD research</strong>
        <p>The section strengthens its arguments by drawing parallels between the neurophysiological mechanisms observed in Long COVID and those well-established in ADRD research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Astrocyte reactivity is a prominent feature of AD and most ADRDs (e.g. in response toxic Ab and Tau species) where it is suspected as a proximal cause of neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, impaired synapse function, and neuronal hyperexcitability." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more direct evidence for Long COVID</strong>
        <p>While the section draws heavily on ADRD research, it would be beneficial to provide more direct evidence specifically related to Long COVID. Are these same mechanisms definitively at play in Long COVID patients?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would strengthen the link between the proposed mechanisms and the observed neurological and cognitive symptoms in Long COVID.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include more studies specifically investigating neuroinflammation, glial reactivity, and synaptic dysfunction in Long COVID patients. If such studies are limited, clearly acknowledge the need for further research in this area and suggest specific research questions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the implications for treatment</strong>
        <p>The section could be enhanced by discussing the potential implications of these findings for the development of new treatments for Long COVID. If these mechanisms are similar to those in ADRD, could existing ADRD treatments be repurposed for Long COVID?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would add a practical dimension to the discussion and highlight the potential translational value of the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing the potential therapeutic implications, exploring the possibility of repurposing existing ADRD treatments or developing new therapies targeting neuroinflammation, glial reactivity, or synaptic dysfunction in Long COVID patients.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the role of cerebrovascular injury</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions cerebrovascular injury, it would be helpful to elaborate on its specific role in Long COVID and how it contributes to the observed EEG abnormalities.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Cerebrovascular injury and atrophy are signals of relative long-term brain damage and have been linked to abnormal rsEEG activity in COVID-19 and ADRD." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more complete understanding of the complex interplay between cerebrovascular dysfunction, neuronal abnormalities, and EEG changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the mechanisms by which cerebrovascular injury can lead to EEG abnormalities, such as reduced blood flow, hypoxia, and neuronal damage. Discuss the potential for using EEG to monitor cerebrovascular function in Long COVID patients.</p>
