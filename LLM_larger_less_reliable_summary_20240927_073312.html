        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research investigates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) as they increase in size and undergo more advanced training methods. The study analyzes the performance of several LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and BLOOM) on various benchmarks to understand how reliability changes with scale and training. Findings suggest that larger, more advanced models do not necessarily become more reliable, sometimes failing on simpler tasks, which necessitates a shift in AI development priorities.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Scaled-up, shaped-up LLMs, while generally more accurate, exhibit decreased reliability on simpler tasks and increased rates of incorrect answers, a phenomenon known as difficulty discordance.</li><li>Advanced LLMs often trade task avoidance (not answering difficult questions) for providing incorrect responses, raising reliability concerns.</li><li>Shaped-up models demonstrate improved prompting stability (less sensitivity to prompt variations) compared to raw models, but some variability persists.</li><li>Human difficulty estimations are predictive of LLM performance, but complete reliability is not achieved even at low difficulty levels.</li><li>Larger models show a tendency towards ultracrepidarianism, answering incorrectly rather than avoiding difficult questions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study employed diverse benchmarks covering various complexities, strengthening the generalizability of findings.</li><li>A detailed methodology, including algorithmic response scoring, ensured reproducibility and efficient processing of large-scale data.</li><li>Explicit consideration of task avoidance provides insights into LLM uncertainty handling.</li><li>Visualizations effectively communicate the complex relationships between model performance, difficulty, and prompting stability.</li><li>The analysis of ultracrepidarianism offers a novel perspective on LLM response behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for difficulty discordance and explore mitigation strategies.</li><li>A deeper analysis of prompt sensitivity could reveal specific prompt features or patterns that contribute to variability.</li><li>Expanding the ethical discussion to address the broader societal implications of LLM unreliability would enhance the study&#39;s impact.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Benchmark Selection</strong>
        <p>The choice of five diverse benchmarks covering various skills and complexities strengthens the generalizability of the findings.</p>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Difficulty Metric Calibration</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions normalizing difficulty functions to a 0-100 scale, more details on the calibration process and its limitations would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We need to take into account that these values are an estimate...and are fitted with a two-parameter logistic function; therefore, these values between 0% and 100% have to be interpreted with caution..." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clearer explanation of the calibration process would enhance transparency and allow readers to better understand the difficulty metrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed description of the two-parameter logistic function used for calibration, including the specific parameters and how they were determined. Discuss the potential limitations of this approach and how they might affect the interpretation of results.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Justify Prompt Template Selection</strong>
        <p>The section mentions using 15 natural prompt templates but doesn&#39;t fully justify the selection process or provide examples. Including examples and explaining how representativeness was ensured would strengthen the methodology.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This process results in 15 natural prompt templates for each benchmark, extracted from or inspired by textbooks, scientific literature, academic exams and the internet." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more details on the prompt templates and their selection would enhance transparency and allow readers to assess the validity of the prompt sensitivity analysis.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the results of the study, focusing on the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance, and prompting stability across different LLM families. The key finding is that while scaled-up, shaped-up models generally improve in correctness, they do not eliminate errors on easy instances and often trade avoidance for incorrect answers, raising concerns about reliability.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Difficulty Concordance:</strong> Human difficulty proxies correlate with LLM correctness, but even easy tasks can be problematic for LLMs, demonstrating difficulty discordance.</li><li><strong>Task Avoidance:</strong> Shaped-up models tend to give incorrect answers more often than avoiding questions, unlike raw models which avoid more.</li><li><strong>Prompting Stability:</strong> Shaped-up models are less sensitive to prompt variations, but pockets of variability remain.</li><li><strong>Involution in Reliability:</strong> There&#39;s no difficulty range where errors are improbable, either due to easy tasks being solved perfectly or difficult tasks being consistently avoided.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Visual Representation of Results</strong>
        <p>The use of figures (Figure 2 and Extended Data Figures 1 and 2) effectively visualizes the performance of different LLM families across benchmarks and difficulty levels.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figure 2 shows the results of a selection of models in the GPT and LLaMA families..." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Analysis of Avoidance Behavior</strong>
        <p>The study explicitly considers avoidance as a response category, providing valuable insights into how LLMs handle uncertainty and difficult questions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"...we also see something more: the percentage of incorrect results increases markedly from the raw to the shaped-up models, as a consequence of substantially reducing avoidance..." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Prompt Sensitivity Analysis</strong>
        <p>The study investigates the impact of prompt variations on LLM performance, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering for reliability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We next wondered whether it is possible that this lack of reliability may be motivated by some prompts being especially poor or brittle..." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Further Investigation of Difficulty Discordance</strong>
        <p>While the study identifies difficulty discordance, further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons why LLMs fail on seemingly easy tasks.</p>
        <div class="quote">"However, despite the predictive power of human difficulty metrics for correctness, full reliability is not even achieved at very low difficulty levels." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the causes of difficulty discordance is crucial for developing more reliable LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the types of errors made on easy tasks. Investigate whether these errors are due to limitations in the models&#39; knowledge, reasoning abilities, or training data. Explore potential solutions, such as incorporating more diverse and representative training data or developing new training methods that focus on improving performance on easy tasks.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore the Trade-off Between Avoidance and Incorrectness</strong>
        <p>The study observes that shaped-up models often trade avoidance for incorrectness. Further research is needed to understand the implications of this trade-off and explore potential mitigation strategies.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Where the raw models tend to give non-conforming outputs...shaped-up models instead give seemingly plausible but wrong answers." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the trade-off between avoidance and incorrectness is essential for designing LLMs that are both accurate and reliable.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Investigate the factors that contribute to the trade-off between avoidance and incorrectness. Explore different training methods and reward functions that encourage appropriate levels of avoidance without sacrificing accuracy. Develop evaluation metrics that capture both correctness and avoidance behavior.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Deeper Analysis of Prompt Sensitivity</strong>
        <p>The study analyzes prompt sensitivity, but a more fine-grained analysis could reveal specific prompt features or patterns that contribute to variability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We analyse prompt sensitivity disaggregating by correctness, avoidance and incorrectness..." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A deeper understanding of prompt sensitivity can inform better prompt engineering practices and improve LLM reliability.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the linguistic features of prompts that lead to different LLM responses. Investigate the impact of prompt length, complexity, and specificity on performance. Develop guidelines for creating prompts that minimize variability and maximize reliability.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses the implications of the study&#39;s findings, highlighting the trade-off between correctness and avoidance in scaled-up, shaped-up LLMs. It emphasizes the need for a shift in AI development, focusing on incorporating human difficulty expectations and output supervision into training and shaping processes. The discussion also addresses limitations of the study and suggests future research directions.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Reliability Re-evaluation:</strong> The current strategies of scaling up and shaping up LLMs may not be optimal for user-driven reliability.</li><li><strong>Human Factors in LLM Training:</strong> Incorporating human difficulty expectations and output supervision into the training process could improve reliability.</li><li><strong>Shifting the Focus of AI Development:</strong> The goal should be to find the right balance between avoidance and correctness, rather than simply eliminating avoidance.</li><li><strong>Specialized LLM Design:</strong> Specialized LLMs, particularly in critical areas like medicine, should incorporate reject options or external AI supervisors to promote appropriate avoidance.</li><li><strong>Limitations and Future Work:</strong> The study acknowledges limitations related to participant expertise, prompt sampling, and the scope of LLM families analyzed. Future research should address these limitations and explore alternative pathways for LLM development.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Insightful Discussion of Trade-offs</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively analyzes the trade-off between correctness and avoidance, highlighting the potential downsides of prioritizing correctness at the expense of reliability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Looking at the two main clusters and the worse results of the shaped-up models on errors and difficulty concordance, we may rush to conclude that all kinds of scaling up and shaping up are inappropriate for ensuring user-driven reliability in the future." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Human Factors</strong>
        <p>The discussion rightly emphasizes the importance of incorporating human factors, such as difficulty expectations and supervision, into LLM development.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Maximizing difficulty concordance and reducing possible incorrect-to-correct errors in human verification could be introduced in the loss function when training and shaping up these models." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Practical Recommendations</strong>
        <p>The discussion offers concrete suggestions for improving LLM reliability, such as incorporating reject options and external AI supervisors.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Specialized language models in medicine and other critical areas may be designed with reject options, or coupled with external AI supervisors, thereby favouring avoidance by teaching the AI models when to refrain from answering37." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Specific Training Methods</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions incorporating human factors into training, it could benefit from elaborating on specific training methods or algorithms that could achieve this.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For this, collective efforts are needed to build larger datasets of human difficulty expectations and output supervision." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more concrete examples of training methods would strengthen the practical implications of the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss specific training methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or adversarial training, and how they could be adapted to incorporate human difficulty expectations and supervision. Provide examples of how these methods could be implemented in practice.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Further Discussion of Ethical Implications</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions the potential hazards of relying on human oversight, it could expand on the broader ethical implications of LLM unreliability, particularly in high-stakes applications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"...we raise awareness that relying on human oversight for these systems is a hazard, especially for areas for which the truth is critical." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more in-depth discussion of ethical implications would enhance the societal relevance of the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the potential consequences of LLM unreliability in specific high-stakes applications, such as medicine, law, and finance. Explore the ethical challenges of deploying LLMs in these domains and propose guidelines for responsible development and deployment.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Potential Challenges of Proposed Solutions</strong>
        <p>The discussion proposes solutions like reject options and AI supervisors, but it could also address the potential challenges of implementing these solutions, such as the complexity of designing reliable reject criteria or the potential biases of AI supervisors.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Specialized language models in medicine and other critical areas may be designed with reject options, or coupled with external AI supervisors..." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging and addressing potential challenges would strengthen the discussion and provide a more balanced perspective.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the potential difficulties of implementing reject options and AI supervisors. Explore the challenges of designing reliable reject criteria that are both sensitive and specific. Address the potential biases of AI supervisors and propose methods for mitigating these biases.</p>
