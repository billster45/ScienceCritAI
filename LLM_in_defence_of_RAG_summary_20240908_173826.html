        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The abstract highlights the shift in natural language processing from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to long-context LLMs due to increased context window sizes. However, it challenges the prevailing view that long-context LLMs are superior by arguing that they can dilute focus on relevant information, potentially impacting answer quality. The paper proposes an Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG) mechanism, demonstrating its ability to enhance RAG performance in long-context question-answering tasks, achieving better results with fewer tokens than long-context LLMs.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Shift from RAG to Long-Context LLMs: The abstract notes the initial reliance on RAG due to context limitations in early LLMs and the recent trend towards long-context LLMs with expanded context windows.</li><li>Diminished Focus in Long-Context LLMs: It argues that while long-context LLMs can handle more text, they may struggle to prioritize relevant information, leading to potential degradation in answer quality.</li><li>Introduction of OP-RAG: The paper introduces an Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG) mechanism designed to improve RAG&#x27;s effectiveness in long-context scenarios.</li><li>Performance Improvement with OP-RAG: It highlights that OP-RAG significantly enhances RAG&#x27;s performance in long-context question-answering applications.</li><li>Efficiency of OP-RAG: The abstract emphasizes that OP-RAG can achieve higher answer quality with fewer tokens compared to long-context LLMs processing the entire context.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Problem Statement</strong>
        <p>The abstract effectively establishes the context and the problem being addressed, highlighting the limitations of both RAG and long-context LLMs in long-context answer generation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Overcoming the limited context limitations in\nearly-generation LLMs, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) has been a reliable solution\nfor context-based answer generation in the past.\nRecently, the emergence of long-context LLMs\nallows the models to incorporate much longer\ntext sequences, making RAG less attractive." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Novel Solution Proposed</strong>
        <p>The introduction of the OP-RAG mechanism offers a new approach to improving RAG&#x27;s performance, addressing the identified limitations of existing methods.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This paper revisits the RAG in\nlong-context answer generation. We propose\nan order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly\nimproves the performance of RAG for longcontext question-answer applications." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Compelling Results Highlighted</strong>
        <p>The abstract effectively summarizes the key findings, showcasing the superior performance of OP-RAG in terms of both answer quality and efficiency.</p>
        <div class="quote">"There exist sweet points where OP-RAG\ncould achieve higher answer quality with much\nless tokens than long-context LLM taking the\nwhole context as input. Extensive experiments\non public benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our OP-RAG." (Page 1)</div>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on OP-RAG&#x27;s Mechanism</strong>
        <p>While the abstract mentions OP-RAG, it provides minimal details about its workings. A brief explanation of how it preserves order and why this is beneficial would enhance understanding.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We propose\nan order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly\nimproves the performance of RAG for longcontext question-answer applications." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing a glimpse into the core idea behind OP-RAG would make the abstract more informative and engaging for readers, potentially attracting more interest in the proposed method.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong>  Briefly mention the core principle of OP-RAG, such as maintaining the original order of retrieved chunks to improve coherence and context understanding. For example, &quot;OP-RAG preserves the original order of retrieved text chunks, enhancing the model&#x27;s ability to understand context and generate more accurate answers.&quot; </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Performance Gains</strong>
        <p>The abstract claims significant performance improvements but lacks specific numbers. Including a brief quantitative comparison (e.g., improvement in F1 score or accuracy) would strengthen the claims.</p>
        <div class="quote">"With\nOP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks\nincreases, the answer quality initially rises, and\nthen declines, forming an inverted U-shaped\ncurve." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying the performance gains would provide concrete evidence of OP-RAG&#x27;s effectiveness, making the abstract more impactful and convincing.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a concise statement about the performance improvement achieved by OP-RAG. For example, &quot;OP-RAG achieves a X% improvement in F1 score compared to long-context LLMs while using significantly fewer tokens.&quot; (Replace X with the actual percentage improvement).</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The introduction section revisits the role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of long-context Language Models (LLMs). It challenges the prevailing notion that long-context LLMs have rendered RAG obsolete, arguing that excessively long contexts can lead to a diluted focus on relevant information and potentially compromise answer quality. The section introduces the concept of Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG), a mechanism designed to enhance RAG&#x27;s performance in long-context question-answering tasks by preserving the order of retrieved chunks from the original text.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Re-examining RAG&#x27;s Relevance: The introduction questions the assumption that long-context LLMs have entirely replaced the need for RAG in handling extensive text corpora.</li><li>Limitations of Long Contexts: It highlights the potential drawbacks of using extremely long contexts in LLMs, suggesting that they may struggle to prioritize relevant information and potentially lead to a decline in answer quality.</li><li>Order Preservation as a Solution: The section introduces the concept of Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG) as a mechanism to address the limitations of traditional RAG and long-context LLMs.</li><li>Improved Performance with OP-RAG: It suggests that preserving the order of retrieved chunks in RAG can significantly improve answer quality in long-context question-answering applications.</li><li>Inverted U-Shaped Performance Curve: The introduction notes that the relationship between the number of retrieved chunks and answer quality in OP-RAG follows an inverted U-shape, indicating an optimal balance between recall and precision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Motivation</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the motivation for revisiting RAG by highlighting the limitations of both traditional RAG and long-context LLMs in long-context answer generation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this work, we re-examine the effectiveness\\nof RAG in long-context answer generation. We\\nobserve that the order of retrieved chunks in the\\ncontext of LLM is vital for the answer quality." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Novel Approach Introduced</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly presents the concept of OP-RAG as a novel approach to enhance RAG&#x27;s performance, addressing the identified limitations of existing methods.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Different from traditional RAG which places the retrieved chunks in a relevance-descending order, we\\npropose to preserve the order of retrieved chunks\\nin the original text. Our experiments show that the\\nproposed order-preserving mechanism significantly\\nimproves the answer quality of RAG." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concise and Focused</strong>
        <p>The introduction remains concise and focused, effectively conveying the key concepts and arguments without unnecessary digressions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Meanwhile, using the proposed order-preserve\\nRAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases,\\nthe answer quality initially rises and then declines." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Order Preservation&#x27;s Benefits</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions the benefits of order preservation, it could provide a more detailed explanation of why maintaining the original order of chunks is crucial for improving answer quality.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Different from traditional RAG which places the retrieved chunks in a relevance-descending order, we\\npropose to preserve the order of retrieved chunks\\nin the original text." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A deeper explanation of the rationale behind order preservation would strengthen the argument for OP-RAG&#x27;s effectiveness and provide a better understanding of its underlying principles.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the explanation by stating that preserving the original order helps maintain the coherence and context of the retrieved information, allowing the LLM to better understand the relationships between different parts of the text and generate more accurate and relevant answers.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Contextualization within RAG Research</strong>
        <p>The introduction could benefit from a more explicit discussion of how OP-RAG relates to existing research on RAG and its variations. Positioning OP-RAG within the broader landscape of RAG research would enhance its novelty and significance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our experiments show that the\\nproposed order-preserving mechanism significantly\\nimproves the answer quality of RAG." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Connecting OP-RAG to existing RAG research would demonstrate its contribution to the field and highlight its unique approach to addressing the challenges of long-context answer generation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong>  Briefly discuss different RAG approaches, such as those focusing on retrieval methods or answer generation techniques, and then position OP-RAG as a novel approach that specifically addresses the issue of context order in long-context scenarios.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the Link to Figure 1</strong>
        <p>The introduction briefly mentions Figure 1 but could strengthen the connection by explicitly explaining how the figure supports the claims made about OP-RAG&#x27;s performance. A more detailed discussion of the figure&#x27;s key findings would enhance the introduction&#x27;s impact.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As shown in Figure 4a, On En.QA\\ndataset of ∞Bench (Zhang et al., 2024), using only\\n16K retrieved tokens, we achieve 44.43 F1 score\\nwith Llama3.1-70B." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clearer explanation of Figure 1&#x27;s relevance would provide stronger evidence for OP-RAG&#x27;s effectiveness and help readers visualize the performance gains achieved by the proposed method.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Refer to Figure 1 directly and highlight the key findings that support the claims made in the introduction. For example, mention the specific F1 scores achieved by OP-RAG with different context lengths and compare them to the performance of long-context LLMs without RAG, emphasizing the superior performance and efficiency of OP-RAG.</p>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        
    <h4>Non-Text Elements</h4>
    
    <details class="non-text-element">
        <summary>Figure Figure 1</summary>
        <p>Figure 1 presents two grouped bar charts comparing the performance of the proposed Order-Preserve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (OP-RAG) with approaches using long-context LLMs without RAG on the En.QA dataset of ∞Bench. Chart (a) displays F1 scores, while chart (b) shows average input token counts. Different configurations of OP-RAG (16K, 24K, 48K) are compared against Llama3.1-70B, GPT-40, and Gemini-1.5-Pro. OP-RAG consistently achieves higher F1 scores with significantly fewer tokens than the long-context LLMs, particularly in the 16K and 24K configurations.</p>

        <h3>Order-Preserve RAG</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section details the core mechanism of Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG), explaining how it differs from traditional RAG and highlighting the impact of context length on its performance. It also presents an ablation study comparing OP-RAG with Vanilla RAG, demonstrating the superior performance of OP-RAG, especially with larger context lengths.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>OP-RAG Mechanism: The section describes the process of retrieving and ordering chunks in OP-RAG, emphasizing the preservation of the original order from the source document.</li><li>Influence of Context Length: An ablation study investigates how varying the number of retrieved chunks (context length) affects OP-RAG&#x27;s performance, revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship.</li><li>Comparison with Vanilla RAG: OP-RAG is compared against Vanilla RAG, showing that OP-RAG significantly outperforms Vanilla RAG, particularly when the number of retrieved chunks is large.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of OP-RAG</strong>
        <p>The section provides a step-by-step explanation of the OP-RAG mechanism, including the retrieval process, the ordering constraint, and a visual comparison with Vanilla RAG in Figure 2.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We retrieve the top k chunks with the highest\\nsimilarity scores with the query and denote the indices of top k chunks by J = {ji }ki=1 . We preserve\\nthe order of chunks in the original long context d,\\nthat is, we constrain\\njl &gt; jm ⇐⇒ l &gt; m." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-structured Ablation Study</strong>
        <p>The ablation study systematically investigates the influence of context length on OP-RAG&#x27;s performance, providing insights into the optimal number of retrieved chunks for different language models.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The influence of context length. We evaluate\\nthe influence of the context length on the performance of the proposed order-preserve RAG. Since\\neach chunk contains 128 tokens, the context length\\nis 128m, where m is the number of the retrieved\\nchunks as the context for generating the answer." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Compelling Evidence for OP-RAG&#x27;s Superiority</strong>
        <p>The comparison with Vanilla RAG clearly demonstrates the performance gains achieved by OP-RAG, particularly with larger context lengths, supporting the paper&#x27;s central argument.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Order-preserve RAG versus vanilla RAG. As\\nshown in Figure 4, when the number of retrieved\\nchunks are small (e.g, 8), the advantage of the proposed order-preserve RAG over vanilla RAG is not\\nconsiderably. In contrast, when the number of retrieved chunks is large, our order-preserve RAG\\nsignificantly outperforms vanilla RAG." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on the Choice of Chunk Size</strong>
        <p>The section mentions a fixed chunk size of 128 tokens but doesn&#x27;t justify this choice. Discussing the rationale behind this decision and exploring the potential impact of different chunk sizes would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We set the chunk size as 128 tokens on all datasets." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The chunk size is a crucial parameter in RAG systems, as it can affect both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency. Exploring its impact would provide a more comprehensive understanding of OP-RAG&#x27;s performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss factors considered when choosing the chunk size, such as the average length of relevant information in the dataset, the computational constraints, and the potential trade-off between recall and precision. Conduct experiments with different chunk sizes to analyze their impact on OP-RAG&#x27;s performance and identify an optimal or near-optimal range.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Details on the Inverted U-Shaped Curve</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions the inverted U-shaped relationship between context length and performance, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the underlying reasons for this phenomenon.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As the context length increases,\\nthe performance initially increases. This is because\\nmore context might have a greater chance of covering the relevant chunk. Nevertheless, as the context\\nlength further increases, the answer quality drops\\nsince more irrelevant chunks are used as distractions." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the inverted U-shape would provide valuable insights into the dynamics of OP-RAG and inform the selection of optimal context lengths.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the types of errors made by OP-RAG at different context lengths. Investigate whether the drop in performance at longer context lengths is primarily due to the inclusion of irrelevant information or other factors such as computational limitations or model capacity. Explore techniques to mitigate the negative impact of longer contexts, such as more sophisticated retrieval methods or mechanisms for filtering out irrelevant chunks.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Generalizability of OP-RAG</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on specific datasets and language models. Discussing the generalizability of OP-RAG to other datasets, domains, and language models would broaden the scope and impact of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To be specific, Llama3.1-8B model achieves\\nthe performance peak when the context length is\\n16K on both EN.QA dataset and EN.MC dataset,\\nwhereas the best performance of Llama3.1-70B\\nmodel is achieved at 48K on EN.QA and 32K on\\nEN.MC." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the generalizability of OP-RAG is crucial for its wider adoption and application in different contexts. Assessing its performance across diverse datasets and language models would provide insights into its robustness and limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct experiments on a wider range of datasets with varying characteristics, such as different domains, text lengths, and question types. Evaluate OP-RAG&#x27;s performance with different language models, including both smaller and larger models, to assess its effectiveness across different model architectures and capabilities. Analyze the factors that influence OP-RAG&#x27;s performance across different datasets and language models, and identify any potential limitations or areas for further improvement.</p>

The results demonstrate that OP-RAG achieves higher answer quality with fewer tokens than these baselines, supporting its superiority in long-context question-answering tasks.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Datasets: The section describes the EN.QA and EN.MC datasets from the ∞Bench benchmark, chosen for their focus on long-context question answering and suitability for evaluating long-context LLMs.</li><li>Implementation Details: It outlines the specific implementation choices, including chunk size, embedding model (BGE-large-env-1.5), and the absence of chunk overlap.</li><li>Ablation Study - Influence of Context Length: This study investigates the relationship between the number of retrieved chunks (context length) and OP-RAG&#x27;s performance, revealing an inverted U-shaped curve where performance initially increases with context length but then declines after reaching an optimal point.</li><li>Comparison with Vanilla RAG: OP-RAG is compared against Vanilla RAG, demonstrating significant performance gains, especially with larger context lengths, highlighting the benefits of preserving chunk order.</li><li>Main Results and Comparisons: The section compares OP-RAG with long-context LLMs without RAG and the SELF-ROUTE mechanism, showing that OP-RAG achieves superior performance (higher F1 scores and accuracy) while using significantly fewer tokens, emphasizing its efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Dataset Description</strong>
        <p>The section provides a clear and informative description of the chosen datasets, including their characteristics, relevance to the research question, and justification for their selection.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We conduct experiments on EN.QA and EN.MC\\\\ndatasets of ∞Bench (Zhang et al., 2024) benchmark, specially designed for long-context QA evaluation. To be specific, En.QA consists of 351\\\\nhuman-annotated question-answer pairs. On average, the long context in En.QA contains 150,374\\\\nwords." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Well-structured Ablation Study</strong>
        <p>The ablation study on the influence of context length is well-structured and provides valuable insights into the optimal context length for OP-RAG, demonstrating the trade-off between recall and precision.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The influence of context length. We evaluate\\\\nthe influence of the context length on the performance of the proposed order-preserve RAG. Since\\\\neach chunk contains 128 tokens, the context length\\\\nis 128m, where m is the number of the retrieved\\\\nchunks as the context for generating the answer." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Performance Comparisons</strong>
        <p>The section presents a thorough comparison of OP-RAG with relevant baseline approaches, including long-context LLMs without RAG and the SELF-ROUTE mechanism, providing strong evidence for OP-RAG&#x27;s superior performance and efficiency.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We compare the proposed order-preserve RAG with\\\\ntwo types of baselines. The first category of approaches uses the long-context LLM without RAG.\\\\nAs shown in Table 1, without RAG, LLM takes a\\\\nhuge number of tokens as input, which is inefficient\\\\nand costly." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
        <ul>
        
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Choice of Embedding Model</strong>
        <p>The section mentions using BGE-large-env-1.5 for embedding extraction but doesn&#x27;t provide a rationale for this choice or explore the potential impact of different embedding models on OP-RAG&#x27;s performance.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We use BGE-large-env1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023) to extract the embedding\\\\nof queries and chunks, by default." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The choice of embedding model can significantly influence the effectiveness of RAG systems, as it determines the quality of the retrieved chunks. Exploring different embedding models would provide a more comprehensive understanding of OP-RAG&#x27;s performance and robustness.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the factors considered when choosing BGE-large-env-1.5, such as its performance on similar tasks, its suitability for long-context documents, and its computational efficiency. Conduct experiments with other embedding models, such as Sentence-BERT or other specialized models for long-context embedding, to analyze their impact on OP-RAG&#x27;s performance and identify any potential improvements or limitations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide Error Analysis and Discussion</strong>
        <p>While the section presents performance results, it lacks a detailed error analysis to understand the types of errors made by OP-RAG and the potential reasons behind them. This would provide valuable insights into the limitations of the approach and guide future research directions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As shown in Table 1, ours signifi-\\\\ncantly outperforms than using much fewer tokens\\\\nin the input of LLMs." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the types of errors made by OP-RAG, such as factual errors, irrelevant answers, or incomplete answers, can help identify areas where the approach can be improved. This analysis can also shed light on the limitations of the datasets or the language models used.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Manually analyze a subset of incorrect answers generated by OP-RAG to categorize the types of errors. Investigate the potential reasons behind these errors, such as limitations in the retrieval process, the ordering mechanism, or the language model&#x27;s ability to understand and synthesize the retrieved information. Discuss the findings of the error analysis and suggest potential solutions or future research directions to address the identified limitations.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the Computational Cost of OP-RAG</strong>
        <p>The section highlights the efficiency of OP-RAG in terms of token count but doesn&#x27;t explicitly address its computational cost compared to other approaches. A discussion of the computational resources required for OP-RAG would provide a more complete picture of its practicality and scalability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In contrast, the proposed order-preserve\\\\nRAG not only significantly reduces the number of\\\\ntokens, but also significantly improves the answer\\\\nquality." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the computational cost of OP-RAG, including the time and resources required for retrieval, chunk ordering, and answer generation, is crucial for assessing its feasibility for real-world applications. This information can also guide future research on optimizing the computational efficiency of OP-RAG.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Measure and report the time taken by OP-RAG for different stages of the process, such as retrieval, chunk ordering, and answer generation. Compare the computational cost of OP-RAG with that of other approaches, such as long-context LLMs without RAG and the SELF-ROUTE mechanism. Discuss the trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and computational cost, and suggest potential strategies for optimizing the computational aspects of OP-RAG.</p>
