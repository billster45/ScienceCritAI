        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research investigates the relationship between social status and jargon use, proposing that individuals with lower status utilize jargon to compensate and signal higher status. Nine studies, employing archival data analysis and experiments, explore this proposition across various contexts, including academic dissertations, business pitches, and live conversations. The research suggests that this behavior is driven by a heightened concern with audience evaluation rather than communication clarity.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Authors from lower-status universities used more jargon in their dissertation and thesis titles.</li><li>Lower-status individuals in simulated business pitch competitions were more likely to select high-jargon descriptions.</li><li>In live conversations, participants assigned lower status used significantly more jargon.</li><li>The effect of low status on jargon use was mediated by evaluative concern.</li><li>Manipulating evaluative concern directly influenced jargon use, with those primed to impress an audience using more jargon.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining archival data analysis with controlled experiments, providing robust evidence for the proposed relationship.</li><li>The studies examined diverse contexts, from academic writing to live conversations, demonstrating the generalizability of the findings.</li><li>The research directly tested the mediating role of evaluative concern, providing insights into the psychological mechanism underlying the status-jargon link.</li><li>The use of large datasets and controlled experiments enhanced the statistical power and internal validity of the studies.</li><li>The research offers a clear and concise definition of jargon, distinguishing it from related concepts like slang and technical terms.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>While the research provides strong evidence for a relationship between status and jargon use, future studies could explore potential moderators, such as audience composition or cultural background, to further refine the theory.</li><li>The research primarily focused on forced-choice paradigms. Incorporating more open-ended tasks, such as allowing participants to generate their own language, could provide richer insights into individual variation in jargon use.</li><li>Future research could investigate the long-term consequences of jargon use on communication effectiveness and interpersonal relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Visually summarizes the key findings across multiple studies, demonstrating the consistent pattern of increased jargon use by low-status individuals in various contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Provides compelling visual evidence supporting the central hypothesis of the paper.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h4>Figures 2 &amp; 3</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Path diagrams illustrating the mediating role of evaluative concern in the relationship between status and jargon use (including legalese).</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Visually depict the mediating mechanism, demonstrating how low status leads to increased evaluative concern, which in turn drives jargon use.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This research establishes a novel link between social status and jargon use, demonstrating that lower-status individuals utilize jargon as a form of compensatory conspicuous communication. The findings contribute to our understanding of how status dynamics influence communication strategies and highlight the role of evaluative concern in driving this behavior. Further research exploring moderators, long-term consequences, and potential interventions could provide a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon and its implications for social interaction.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This abstract summarizes a research paper exploring the relationship between jargon use and social status. It proposes that jargon serves as a status compensation mechanism, where individuals with lower status use more jargon to signal higher status. Nine studies, including archival data analysis and experiments, support this proposition, finding a correlation between lower status and increased jargon use across various contexts like academic dissertations, business pitches, and live conversations. The research suggests that this effect is driven by increased concern with audience evaluations.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Jargon as Status Compensation:</strong> Lower-status individuals use jargon to compensate for their perceived lower status.</li><li><strong>Archival Data Analysis:</strong> Analysis of dissertations revealed that authors from lower-status schools used more jargon.</li><li><strong>Experimental Evidence:</strong> Experiments confirmed that low status causally increases jargon use, even in live conversations.</li><li><strong>Mediation by Evaluative Concern:</strong> The effect is mediated by a heightened concern with audience evaluations rather than communication clarity.</li><li><strong>Conspicuous Communication:</strong> Jargon use is presented as a form of compensatory and conspicuous communication.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for research on jargon use as a status compensation strategy. It defines jargon, differentiating it from slang and technical terms, and outlines its communicative and signaling functions. The authors hypothesize that low-status individuals use more jargon to signal higher status, driven by a concern for audience evaluation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Jargon Definition:</strong> Jargon is defined as specialized words or expressions used by a particular group, substituting for accessible alternatives, and difficult for outsiders to understand.</li><li><strong>Forms of Jargon:</strong> The introduction focuses on linguistic complexity, acronyms, and legalese as forms of jargon.</li><li><strong>Functions of Jargon:</strong> Jargon serves both communicative (clarity within a group) and signaling (group membership and status) functions.</li><li><strong>Status Compensation:</strong> The core proposition is that low-status individuals use jargon to compensate for their lower status.</li><li><strong>Communication Goals:</strong> The authors suggest that differing communication goals mediate the relationship between status and jargon use; low-status individuals prioritize evaluative concern over clarity.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Engaging Opening</strong>
        <p>The introduction uses relatable examples of jargon across different professions to pique reader interest.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Why do business people describe their abilities as their tendency to synergistically leverage strategic competitive advantages?" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Definition</strong>
        <p>The authors provide a clear and comprehensive definition of jargon, distinguishing it from related concepts like slang and technical terms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Accordingly, we define jargon as socially learned words or expressions used by a particular profession or specialized group, which are used in place of more broadly accessible and less formal alternatives, and are difficult for outsiders to understand." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strong Theoretical Grounding</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively integrates relevant theories, such as Grice&#39;s maxims and uncertainty identity theory, to support their hypotheses.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Uncertainty identity theory holds that when one’s group membership is in question, one will engage in prototypical group behavior" (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Status Signaling Literature</strong>
        <p>While the introduction mentions compensatory consumption, it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the broader status signaling literature.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Besides directly contributing to one’s group, there are other indirect and symbolic ways that individuals can attempt to signal higher status to fellow group members." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more comprehensive review would strengthen the theoretical foundation for the proposed link between jargon and status.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a more detailed discussion of different status signaling strategies and their effectiveness.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Audience Focus</strong>
        <p>The introduction could more explicitly define the intended audience for jargon use in the status compensation context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We propose that jargon can also be used to signal a speaker’s status within a group, i.e., that the speaker is a well-respected group member." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specifying the target audience would clarify the social dynamics at play and refine the hypotheses.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Clearly state whether the jargon use is aimed at in-group members, out-group members, or both, and how this might influence its effectiveness.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Potential Moderators</strong>
        <p>The introduction could briefly discuss potential moderators of the relationship between status and jargon use, such as audience composition or group status.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Considering potential moderators would enhance the theoretical depth and provide avenues for future research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly mention factors that might influence the strength or direction of the relationship between status and jargon use, such as the presence of out-group members or the overall status of the group.</p>
    </li>
    
            </ul>

            <h3>Study 1a: Status as a predictor of jargon use in dissertation and master’s thesis titles</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 1a investigates the relationship between author status and jargon use in dissertation and thesis titles. Using a dataset of over 64,000 titles from universities ranked by US News and World Reports, the study found a positive correlation between lower university status and increased jargon use, measured by linguistic complexity. This suggests that authors from lower-ranked schools compensate for their perceived lower status by using more jargon.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>Dataset:</strong> 64,956 dissertations and theses from US News and World Reports ranked universities.</li><li><strong>Status Measure:</strong> US News and World Reports university rankings (1-232).</li><li><strong>Jargon Measure:</strong> Readability of titles, calculated using six readability measures and averaged.</li><li><strong>Control Variables:</strong> Number of pages, publication year, degree type, and primary topic area.</li><li><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Lower-status school authors used more jargon (higher linguistic complexity) in their titles.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Large Sample Size</strong>
        <p>The study uses a large and comprehensive dataset of over 64,000 dissertations and theses, enhancing the statistical power and generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our final sample included information on 64,956 dissertations and theses." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Objective Status Measure</strong>
        <p>Using US News and World Report rankings provides a relatively objective and widely recognized measure of university status, although imperfect.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To assess author status, we used The US News and World Reports university rankings..." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Multiple Readability Measures</strong>
        <p>Employing six different readability measures and averaging them provides a more robust and nuanced assessment of linguistic complexity than relying on a single measure.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we utilized a combination of six widely accepted measures: the Coleman Liau Index, the Spache Readability Score, the Dale Chall Readability Score, the SMOG Index, the Gunning Fog Score, and the Flesch Kincaid Readability Score." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Alternative Status Measures</strong>
        <p>While US News rankings are widely used, exploring alternative status indicators, such as faculty publications or research funding, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of status effects.</p>
        <div class="quote">"While the US News and World Reports university rankings, like all university rankings, are an imperfect indicator of university quality..." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Relying solely on one ranking system may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of university status.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Incorporate additional status measures, such as faculty publications, research grants, or peer ratings, to triangulate the assessment of university status.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Examine Title Length</strong>
        <p>Longer titles may inherently have higher readability scores. Controlling for title length could help isolate the effect of jargon independent of title length.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Title length could confound the relationship between status and readability.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include title length as a control variable in the regression analysis or analyze the relationship between status and jargon use within titles of similar lengths.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Disciplinary Differences</strong>
        <p>Jargon use may vary significantly across academic disciplines. Analyzing disciplinary differences could reveal whether the status-jargon relationship is consistent across fields.</p>
        <div class="quote">"our analysis strategy involved fitting a fixed-effects regression model with primary topic area (e.g., mechanical engineering, geography, sociology, etc.) as the grouping variable to account for the nestedness of dissertations within certain topics." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Disciplinary norms and conventions could influence both jargon use and the interpretation of readability scores.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct separate analyses within different academic disciplines or include interaction terms between status and discipline in the regression model.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 1b examines the relationship between author status and the use of acronyms in dissertation and thesis titles. Using the same dataset as Study 1a, this study found that authors from lower-status schools were more likely to include acronyms in their titles, suggesting another form of jargon use as status compensation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Same as Study 1a (64,956 dissertations and theses).</li><li><strong>Status Measure:</strong> US News and World Reports university rankings.</li><li><strong>Jargon Measure:</strong> Binary variable indicating the presence or absence of acronyms in the title.</li><li><strong>Control Variables:</strong> Number of pages, publication year, degree type, and primary topic area.</li><li><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Authors from lower-status schools were more likely to use acronyms in their titles.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>

        <strong>Consistent Dataset</strong>
        <p>Using the same dataset as Study 1a allows for direct comparison of findings across different forms of jargon.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We used the same dataset from Study 1a." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Simple Jargon Measure</strong>
        <p>The binary measure of acronym presence/absence provides a clear and easily interpretable indicator of jargon use.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our final DV was a binary variable (1/0) indicating whether or not the title contained an acronym." (Page 6)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Direct Hypothesis Test</strong>
        <p>The study directly tests the hypothesis that low status increases acronym use, providing further evidence for the status compensation theory.</p>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Analyze Acronym Frequency</strong>
        <p>While presence/absence is informative, analyzing the frequency of acronyms could reveal more nuanced patterns of jargon use.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Frequency data could provide a more sensitive measure of jargon use and potentially reveal non-linear relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Count the number of acronyms in each title and analyze the relationship between status and acronym frequency.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Distinguish Acronym Types</strong>
        <p>Not all acronyms are created equal. Differentiating between well-established acronyms and newly coined ones could provide further insights.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Different types of acronyms may serve different communicative and signaling functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Categorize acronyms based on their familiarity or prevalence in the relevant field and analyze their relationship with status separately.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Interaction with Linguistic Complexity</strong>
        <p>Exploring the interaction between acronym use and linguistic complexity could reveal how different forms of jargon are used together.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Unlike linguistic complexity, acronyms are often used to simplify language." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Authors might use acronyms to simplify complex language or, conversely, use complex language alongside acronyms to further signal status.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the relationship between status, acronym use, and linguistic complexity simultaneously, potentially using interaction terms in the regression model.</p>

            <h3>Study 2a: Causal evidence that low status increases jargon use</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 2a provides causal evidence for the hypothesis that low status increases jargon use. Participants, MBA students, were placed in a simulated startup pitch competition and assigned to different status conditions (lower, same, or higher status). They then chose between a high-jargon and low-jargon pitch description. Results showed that lower-status participants were more likely to select the high-jargon pitch.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> Participants&#39; status was manipulated by describing their competitors as established entrepreneurs (lower status), fellow MBA students (same status), or undergraduate students (higher status).</li><li><strong>Pitch Descriptions:</strong> Two pitch descriptions were created, one with high jargon and one with low jargon, but conveying the same essential information.</li><li><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> The chosen pitch description (high-jargon or low-jargon) served as the dependent variable.</li><li><strong>Control Variables:</strong> Age, gender, startup experience, and native language were controlled for.</li><li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> Participants in the lower status condition were more likely to choose the high-jargon pitch description.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Causal Design</strong>
        <p>The experimental manipulation of status allows for causal inferences about the relationship between status and jargon use.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study 2a was designed to establish experimental evidence that low status causes an increase in jargon use." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Relevant Sample</strong>
        <p>The use of MBA students as participants provides a relevant sample for studying jargon use in a business context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Five-hundred and fifty-six students enrolled in a MBA program at a university on the East Coast of the United States completed this study as part of their course requirements" (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Manipulation</strong>
        <p>The status manipulation, based on the described competitors, is relatively straightforward and easy to understand.</p>
        <div class="quote">"we manipulated participants’ sense of relative status by describing the other pitch competition participants as recent MBA graduates and entrepreneurs who have already established their companies (lower-status condition), first year MBA students (same-status condition), or undergraduate students (higher-status condition)."

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen Status Manipulation</strong>
        <p>The status manipulation could be strengthened by incorporating more diverse and impactful status cues, such as achievements or recognition.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A stronger manipulation might lead to a larger effect size and increase the ecological validity of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include additional status cues, such as awards won, leadership positions held, or performance evaluations, in the descriptions of competitors.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Different Jargon Types</strong>
        <p>The study focuses on business jargon. Exploring other types of jargon, such as academic or technical jargon, would broaden the scope of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants viewed and selected one of two pitch descriptions that were functionally equivalent but varied in their level of business jargon." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The relationship between status and jargon use might vary depending on the type of jargon used.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Create pitch descriptions or other materials that incorporate different types of jargon and compare the effects of status across these different contexts.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Measure Evaluative Concern</strong>
        <p>While the study demonstrates a link between status and jargon use, it doesn&#39;t explore the underlying mechanism. Measuring evaluative concern could provide insights into why low-status individuals choose high-jargon pitches.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the mediating role of evaluative concern would strengthen the theoretical contribution of the study.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a measure of evaluative concern, such as asking participants how concerned they were about the judges&#39; evaluations, and test whether it mediates the relationship between status and jargon use.</p>

        <summary>Figure 1</summary>
        <p>Figure 1, titled &#39;Use of jargon by status condition across experiments,&#39; displays four bar charts illustrating the relationship between status and jargon use across multiple studies (2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, and 2c). Each chart compares low-status and high-status conditions, showing the percentage of participants selecting high-jargon options or the number of jargon terms used. The figure consistently demonstrates that low-status participants tend to use more jargon than high-status participants across different contexts, such as pitch selection, title selection, and conversational jargon use. For example, in Study 2a, approximately 41% of low-status participants selected the high-jargon pitch, compared to around 29% of high-status participants. In Study 2c, low-status participants used an average of 2.62 jargon terms, while high-status participants used an average of 1.48.</p>

            <h3>Study 2b: Replication study showing that low status increases jargon use</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 2b replicates Study 2a, investigating the causal relationship between low status and jargon use in a simulated startup pitch competition. This study includes a manipulation check and a consistent audience composition to address limitations of the previous study. The results confirm that lower-status participants are more likely to choose high-jargon pitch descriptions.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Replication:</strong> This study replicates the main effect of Study 2a.</li><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> Participants&#39; status was manipulated by describing competitors as established entrepreneurs (low status) or high school students (high status).</li><li><strong>Audience Control:</strong> The audience was held constant as faculty judges for all participants.</li><li><strong>Jargon Measure:</strong> Participants chose between high- and low-jargon pitch descriptions.</li><li><strong>Manipulation Check:</strong> A three-item measure confirmed the effectiveness of the status manipulation.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Addresses Prior Limitations</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of a manipulation check and a consistent audience strengthens the internal validity and addresses limitations of Study 2a.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study 2b was designed to replicate our hypothesized main effect and address two limitations of the previous study." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Direct Replication</strong>
        <p>The study directly replicates the core manipulation and dependent variable of Study 2a, providing stronger evidence for the hypothesized effect.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants viewed and selected one of the same two pitch descriptions that we described in the previous study that were either high or low in jargon use." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clearer Status Manipulation</strong>
        <p>Comparing MBA students to high school students provides a clearer status difference than the manipulation in Study 2a.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Prior to the pitch selection, we manipulated participants’ sense of relative status by describing the other pitch competition participants as recent MBA graduates and entrepreneurs who have already established their companies (lower-status condition) or local high school students (higher-status condition)."

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Dependent Variables</strong>
        <p>Relying solely on pitch description choice limits the range of jargon use. Allowing participants to write their own descriptions could provide more nuanced data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more open-ended task would allow for a wider range of jargon use and potentially reveal individual differences in status compensation strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide participants with the startup idea and ask them to write their own pitch descriptions, then code the descriptions for jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Vary Audience Composition</strong>
        <p>While controlling for audience is important, exploring how audience composition influences jargon use could provide valuable insights.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To hold constant the audience, subjects in both conditions were explicitly told that a panel of faculty members from their school would serve as competition judges." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Jargon use might be strategically adjusted based on the perceived status or expertise of the audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Vary the audience composition (e.g., fellow students, industry professionals, general public) and examine how this affects participants&#39; jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Measure Perceived Status of Competitors</strong>
        <p>While the manipulation check assesses perceived relative status, directly measuring the perceived status of competitors could provide additional insights.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would allow for a more precise assessment of the status manipulation and its impact on jargon use.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include items asking participants to rate the status, competence, or prestige of their competitors.</p>

            <h3>Study 2c: Low status increase jargon use during a synchronous conversation</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 2c tested the hypothesis that low status increases jargon use in a live conversation setting. Participants were paired and assigned roles as either an Academic Researcher or a Non-Profit Representative. The Academic Researcher&#39;s status was manipulated (low or high), while the Non-Profit Representative served as a conversational partner. Researchers were given research summaries containing jargon and non-jargon equivalents, and their use of jargon during the conversation was measured. The study found that low-status researchers used significantly more jargon than high-status researchers.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Live Conversation:</strong> This study used a live, synchronous online conversation to assess jargon use.</li><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> The Academic Researcher role&#39;s status was manipulated (low vs. high).</li><li><strong>Jargon Measurement:</strong> The number of jargon terms used by the Academic Researcher, not qualified by non-jargon equivalents, was the primary dependent variable.</li><li><strong>Control of Jargon Exposure:</strong> Participants were given research summaries containing both jargon and non-jargon equivalents to ensure they had a choice in their language use.</li><li><strong>Conversation Partner:</strong> The Non-Profit Representative role served as a conversational partner, prompting discussion of the research.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Ecological Validity</strong>
        <p>Using a live conversation increases the ecological validity of the study compared to previous forced-choice paradigms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study 2c sought to extend our findings by testing Hypothesis 1 in the context of a live, synchronous conversational setting in which subjects freely interacted with one another." (Page 8)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Controlled Jargon Exposure</strong>
        <p>Providing both jargon and non-jargon equivalents in the research summaries allows for a clearer assessment of jargon choice.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We also paired each jargon term with its non-jargon equivalent to provide participants a clear choice of which to use, if any, in the conversation." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Motivated Conversation</strong>
        <p>The bonus payment for meaningful conversation encourages participant engagement and reduces the likelihood of perfunctory responses.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To motivate participants to take the task seriously and to encourage a healthy back and forth conversation, we further told participants that if they successfully answered all of their partner’s questions and have a conversation of at least six exchanges (three each), they would earn a 20% bonus payment."

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Analyze Conversational Dynamics</strong>
        <p>The study focuses on jargon frequency. Analyzing conversational dynamics, such as turn-taking and interruptions, could provide additional insights.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Status differences might affect not only jargon use but also broader conversational patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Code the conversations for turn-taking, interruptions, and other conversational dynamics and analyze their relationship with status and jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Vary Conversation Partner Status</strong>
        <p>The Non-Profit Representative&#39;s status is not manipulated. Varying their status could reveal how status dynamics between conversation partners influence jargon use.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As stated previously, those assigned to the role of Non Profit Representative did not undergo any status manipulation." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Jargon use might be influenced by the relative status of the conversation partner.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Manipulate the Non-Profit Representative&#39;s status (e.g., representing a high-status vs. low-status organization) and examine how this affects the Academic Researcher&#39;s jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Post-Conversation Perceptions</strong>
        <p>The study doesn&#39;t assess how jargon use affects perceptions of the speaker. Measuring post-conversation perceptions of competence, status, and trustworthiness could be valuable.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Jargon use might have unintended consequences on how the speaker is perceived.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Ask the Non-Profit Representatives to rate the Academic Researchers on various dimensions (e.g., competence, status, trustworthiness) after the conversation and analyze the relationship between jargon use and these ratings.</p>

            <h3>Study 2d: Low status increases acronym use</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 2d experimentally tested the impact of status on acronym use among undergraduate business students. Participants imagined creating a professional profile for a networking platform, with their status manipulated by the described prominence of MBA students (low status) or incoming freshmen (high status). Low-status participants used more acronyms in their profiles, supporting the hypothesis that low status increases jargon use, specifically acronyms, as a form of status compensation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Participants:</strong> Undergraduate business students.</li><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> Participants&#39; status was manipulated by indicating whether the online platform would predominantly feature MBA students (low status) or incoming freshmen (high status).</li><li><strong>Task:</strong> Participants wrote a professional summary based on provided role information containing both acronym and long-form versions of business terms.</li><li><strong>Jargon Measure:</strong> The number of acronyms used in the professional summary, excluding those accompanied by their long-form equivalents.</li><li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> Low-status participants used more acronyms than high-status participants.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Specific Jargon Focus</strong>
        <p>This study focuses specifically on acronym use, providing a more nuanced understanding of how a particular type of jargon is used for status compensation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study 2d was designed to provide an experimental test of our hypothesis that low status increases acronym use." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Realistic Scenario</strong>
        <p>The professional profile creation task provides a realistic and relatable context for studying acronym use in professional communication.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants – all of whom were current undergraduate business students – were asked to imagine that the business school plans to launch an online professional networking initiative called [business school name] Connect" (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Controlled Jargon Choice</strong>
        <p>Providing both acronym and long-form versions of terms allows for a clear assessment of participants&#39; active choice to use acronyms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Importantly, for each of the twelve acronyms included in the professional background text, we included both the long-form equivalent (e.g., key performance indicators) and acronym (i.e., KPI) versions of the text." (Page 11)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Acronym Familiarity</strong>
        <p>The study assumes participants are familiar with the acronyms. Measuring familiarity could control for pre-existing knowledge and strengthen the findings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Participants might use acronyms they already know, regardless of status. Controlling for familiarity would isolate the effect of the manipulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Assess participants&#39; familiarity with the acronyms before the task and include it as a covariate in the analysis.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Vary Audience Expertise</strong>
        <p>The intended audience for the profile is not explicitly defined. Varying audience expertise (e.g., business professionals vs. general public) could reveal how audience affects acronym use.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acronym use might be strategically adjusted based on the perceived expertise of the audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Manipulate the described audience for the professional profile (e.g., recruiters, fellow students, general public) and examine its effect on acronym use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Examine Profile Completeness</strong>
        <p>The study focuses on acronym use. Analyzing other aspects of the profile, such as length and detail, could provide a more holistic understanding of self-presentation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Status might influence not only jargon use but also other aspects of self-presentation in professional contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the length, detail, and overall quality of the professional summaries in addition to acronym use.</p>

            <h3>Study 3a: Evaluative concern as a mediator of the low status → Jargon use effect</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 3a explores evaluative concern as a mediator between low status and jargon use. Participants, acting as researchers from low- or high-status schools, chose between jargon-laden and simpler titles for a conference presentation. Results showed low-status participants chose the jargon-heavy title more often, driven by a higher concern for audience evaluation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> Participants were assigned to either a low- or high-status condition based on their fictional school&#39;s prestige.</li><li><strong>Jargon Manipulation:</strong> Two title options were presented, one with high jargon and one with low jargon.</li><li><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> Title selection (high jargon vs. low jargon).</li><li><strong>Mediator:</strong> Evaluative concern, measured through coded open-ended responses about title selection rationale.</li><li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> Low status increased jargon use, mediated by evaluative concern.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Direct Mediator Test</strong>
        <p>The study directly measures evaluative concern, providing a test of the proposed mediating mechanism.</p>
        <div class="quote">"After participants selected a title, we assessed our hypothesized mediator by asking participants why they selected the title they did (in an open-ended manner)." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Manipulation</strong>
        <p>The status manipulation, based on school prestige and research topic respect, is straightforward.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Participants were put in the role of an academic researcher who studies non-human primates and randomly assigned to either a low-status or high-status condition in which they read that they work at a &quot;very low-status [high-status] school and the topic you work on is looked down upon [highly respected] in current academic circles.&quot;" (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Relevant Context</strong>
        <p>The academic conference setting provides a relevant context for studying the relationship between status, evaluative concern, and jargon use.</p>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Manipulate Evaluative Concern</strong>
        <p>While measuring the mediator is valuable, manipulating evaluative concern experimentally would provide stronger causal evidence.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A manipulation would allow for a more direct test of the causal role of evaluative concern in driving jargon use.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Participants could be given instructions that emphasize either the importance of impressing the audience or the importance of clear communication.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Jargon Measures</strong>
        <p>Relying solely on title selection limits the range of jargon use. Allowing participants to write abstracts or summaries could provide richer data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more open-ended task would capture a wider range of jargon use and potentially reveal more nuanced patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Instead of choosing between titles, participants could be asked to write their own titles or even short abstracts for their presentations, which would then be coded for jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Individual Differences</strong>
        <p>The study doesn&#39;t account for individual differences in status sensitivity or communication styles. Measuring these could provide further insights.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Individual differences could moderate the relationship between status, evaluative concern, and jargon use.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include measures of status sensitivity, public self-consciousness, or need for approval, and explore their interactions with the status manipulation and jargon use.</p>

        <summary>Figure 2</summary>
        <p>Figure 2, titled &#39;The effect of status on jargon use is mediated by evaluative concern, Study 3a,&#39; is a path diagram illustrating the mediation model. It shows how status influences jargon use through evaluative concern. The diagram includes three variables: status (1 = low, 2 = high), evaluative concern, and jargon use. A solid arrow connects status to evaluative concern with a label of &#39;-.90***&#39; indicating a strong negative relationship. Another solid arrow connects evaluative concern to jargon use with a label of &#39;.77***&#39; indicating a strong positive relationship. A dotted arrow connects status directly to jargon use, and the label &#39;-.50*/.01ns&#39; below this arrow suggests a negative relationship that becomes non-significant when the mediator is included. The caption indicates that a bootstrapping mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect effect (bias-corrected 95% CI = [-0.11, -0.05]).</p>

            <p>Study 3b replicates the findings of Study 3a but within the context of legal jargon. It examines whether low status among trial lawyers leads to increased use of legalese and if this effect is mediated by evaluative concern. Participants were assigned to either a high- or low-status condition and asked to select a title for a presentation, one with and one without legalese. The study found that low-status participants were more likely to choose the title containing legalese, and this effect was mediated by evaluative concern.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Status Manipulation:</strong> Participants were assigned to high- or low-status conditions based on their fictional law firm&#39;s prestige and the perceived respect for their area of legal practice.</li><li><strong>Jargon Manipulation:</strong> Participants chose between two titles for a presentation, one using legalese and one using plain language.</li><li><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> Title selection (legalese vs. plain language).</li><li><strong>Mediator:</strong> Evaluative concern, measured through coded open-ended responses explaining title choice rationale.</li><li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> Low status increased legalese use, mediated by evaluative concern.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Replication and Extension</strong>
        <p>This study replicates the findings of Study 3a in a new context (legal jargon), strengthening the generalizability of the status-jargon relationship and the mediating role of evaluative concern.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Study 3b was designed to demonstrate that low status causally increases the use of legal jargon, i.e., legalese. We again tested for whether evaluative concern mediated this effect." (Page 13)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Practical Relevance</strong>
        <p>The use of legal jargon as the focus adds practical relevance to the study, as legalese is a common form of jargon with real-world implications for communication and persuasion.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Thus, legalese is simply the name for a domain specific form of jargon." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Mediation Test</strong>
        <p>The study clearly measures evaluative concern and tests its mediating role, providing insights into the psychological mechanism underlying the status-jargon link.</p>
        <div class="quote">"After participants selected a title, we asked participants why they selected the title they did (in an open-ended manner). As in Experiment 3a, three coders who were blind to condition coded these comments for how much they focused on evaluative concern vs communication concern using the same measures as Experiment 3a." (Page 13)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Manipulate Evaluative Concern</strong>
        <p>While measuring evaluative concern provides correlational evidence for mediation, manipulating it experimentally would strengthen causal inferences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A direct manipulation would allow for a stronger test of the causal role of evaluative concern in driving legalese use.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Instruct participants to prioritize either impressing the audience or communicating clearly, and then measure their subsequent legalese use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Real-World Legal Communication</strong>
        <p>The study uses a hypothetical scenario. Examining jargon use in real-world legal documents or courtroom interactions would enhance ecological validity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Real-world legal communication involves higher stakes and more complex dynamics than the experimental task.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze legal documents, transcripts of court proceedings, or conduct field studies observing lawyer-client interactions to assess jargon use in more naturalistic settings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consider Audience Expertise</strong>
        <p>The study doesn&#39;t specify the audience&#39;s legal expertise. Varying audience expertise could reveal how jargon use is strategically adjusted based on audience knowledge.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Lawyers might use more legalese when addressing other legal professionals than when communicating with clients or the general public.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Manipulate the described audience for the presentation (e.g., legal experts, general public) and examine how this affects participants&#39; legalese use.</p>

        <summary>Figure 3</summary>
        <p>Figure 3, titled &#39;The effect of status on legalese jargon use is mediated by evaluative concern, Study 3b&#39;, presents a path diagram illustrating the mediating role of evaluative concern in the relationship between status and the use of legalese jargon. The diagram depicts three variables: status (1 = low, 2 = high), evaluative concern, and legalese jargon use. A solid arrow connects status to evaluative concern, labeled &#39;-.66**&#39;, indicating a significant negative relationship. Another solid arrow connects evaluative concern to legalese jargon use, labeled &#39;.93***&#39;, indicating a significant positive relationship. A dotted arrow connects status directly to legalese jargon use, labeled &#39;-.74*/.026ns&#39;, suggesting a negative relationship that becomes non-significant when the mediator is included. The caption mentions a significant indirect effect revealed by a bootstrapping mediation analysis (bias-corrected 95% CI = [-0.16, -0.03]).</p>
        
        <div class="first-mention">
            <h5>First Mention</h5>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "Furthermore, a bootstrapping mediation analysis revealed that evaluative concern mediated the effect of status on jargon selection (bias-corrected 95% CI = [-0.16, -0.03]) (see Fig. 3)."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This mention appears at the end of the results and discussion section of Study 3b, after reporting a significant relationship between status and legalese title selection. It refers to the figure to visually represent the mediation analysis results.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 3 visually supports the hypothesis that evaluative concern mediates the relationship between status and legalese jargon use. It demonstrates that low status leads to increased evaluative concern, which in turn leads to greater use of legalese jargon. This finding strengthens the argument that jargon use, in this case legalese, serves as a status compensation mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Study 3c: Manipulating the mediator of evaluative concern</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Study 3c experimentally tested the mediating role of evaluative concern in the relationship between status and jargon use. Researchers manipulated participants&#39; communication goals, focusing them on either evaluative concern (impressing the audience) or communication clarity (ensuring understanding). Participants then chose between a high-jargon and a low-jargon title for a presentation. The study found that participants primed with evaluative concern were more likely to select the high-jargon title, supporting the hypothesis that evaluative concern drives the low-status-jargon link.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Communication Motive Manipulation:</strong> Participants were randomly assigned to either an evaluative concern or a communication clarity condition.</li><li><strong>Status Neutralization:</strong> Unlike previous studies, participants&#39; own status was not explicitly mentioned.</li><li><strong>Prestigious Setting:</strong> The study context involved presenting at a prestigious Ivy League school.</li><li><strong>Jargon Measure:</strong> Participants chose between high- and low-jargon titles for their presentation.</li><li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> Participants in the evaluative concern condition chose the high-jargon title more frequently.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Causal Mediation Test</strong>
        <p>By manipulating communication motives, the study provides a stronger causal test of the mediating role of evaluative concern than correlational mediation analyses.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In Study 3c, we adopted an experimental-causal-chain approach to demonstrate mediation by directly manipulating the mediator—communication motive—and testing its causal effect on jargon use." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Controlled Setting</strong>
        <p>The study controls for participants&#39; own status, isolating the effect of the communication motive manipulation on jargon use.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Unlike Study 3a, their own status was not mentioned." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Consistent Jargon Measure</strong>
        <p>Using the same title choices as in Study 3a allows for direct comparison of results across studies and strengthens the reliability of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The titles were identical to those used in Study 3a." (Page 14)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Strength of Manipulation</strong>
        <p>The study could benefit from assessing the effectiveness of the communication motive manipulation, ensuring that it successfully induced the intended focus.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A weak manipulation could limit the interpretability of the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a manipulation check, such as asking participants to rate their level of concern for impressing the audience or for clear communication, to verify the effectiveness of the manipulation.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Vary Audience Status</strong>
        <p>The study uses a high-status audience (Ivy League school). Varying audience status could reveal how the interaction between audience status and communication motive influences jargon use.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Next week you are visiting a very prestigious, Ivy League school to give a talk." (Page 14)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Evaluative concern might be heightened when addressing a high-status audience, leading to greater jargon use.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Manipulate the status of the audience (e.g., prestigious vs. less prestigious institution) and examine its interaction with the communication motive manipulation.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Examine Behavioral Consequences</strong>
        <p>The study focuses on title selection. Exploring behavioral consequences, such as how jargon use affects audience perceptions or evaluations, would enhance practical relevance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the impact of jargon use on actual outcomes, such as audience engagement or speaker credibility, would provide more valuable insights.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a measure of audience perceptions of the speaker or their research after reading the chosen title, or conduct a follow-up study where participants actually deliver the presentation and assess audience reactions.</p>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Summary</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the key findings across all nine studies, highlighting the consistent pattern of increased jargon use by low-status individuals.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Across nine studies involving archival data and experiments, we identified a critical predictor of jargon use – the status level of the speaker." (Page 15)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Theoretical Contribution</strong>
        <p>The discussion clearly articulates the theoretical contributions of the research, introducing the concept of &quot;compensatory conspicuous communication&quot; and linking it to existing literature on status signaling.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Overall, we found support for our core proposition that jargon use is a novel form of status compensation which we refer to as compensatory conspicuous communication." (Page 15)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Balanced Perspective</strong>
        <p>The discussion acknowledges both the strengths and limitations of the research, providing a balanced and nuanced perspective on the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We also recognize several limitations of the current work." (Page 15)</div>

            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Practical Implications</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions theoretical contributions, it could further elaborate on the practical implications of the findings for communication in various settings, such as workplaces or educational institutions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the practical implications would increase the impact and relevance of the research for a wider audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss how the findings could inform communication training programs, organizational policies, or educational interventions aimed at improving communication effectiveness and reducing status-related disparities in jargon use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Deepen Discussion of Ethical Implications</strong>
        <p>The discussion briefly mentions the potential for jargon to be used for obfuscation. Expanding on the ethical implications of using jargon to manipulate or exclude others would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Thus, future work could examine other contexts in which jargon and other forms of linguistic complexity may be intentionally used to facilitate unethical behavior." (Page 16)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Jargon can be used to create power imbalances and reinforce social inequalities. Addressing these ethical concerns would add depth and social responsibility to the research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss the potential for jargon to be used to mislead, exclude, or manipulate others, and suggest ways to mitigate these risks. Consider the ethical implications of using jargon in different contexts, such as marketing, politics, or healthcare.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Refine Future Research Suggestions</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides several interesting future research directions. Refining these suggestions by providing more specific research questions and methodologies would be helpful.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Future research could also explore when the desire to belong (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995) is more strongly predictive of jargon use than the desire for status (Anderson, Hildreth, &amp; Howland, 2015)." (Page 15)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> More concrete suggestions would facilitate future research and increase the likelihood of these directions being pursued.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For each suggested research direction, provide specific research questions, hypotheses, and potential methodologies. For example, instead of simply suggesting exploring non-linear relationships, propose a specific study design to test for a curvilinear relationship between status and jargon use.</p>
