            <h3>Methods</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details the methodology employed in the systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of pomegranate supplementation on athletes and healthy individuals. It outlines the search strategy used across multiple databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study selection process, data extraction and analysis methods, quality assessment procedures using Cochrane criteria, and ethical considerations.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and Ovid for relevant English-language, full-text articles published since March 2024. The search strategy was developed using PICO format and PRISMA guidelines, incorporating MeSH terms and keywords related to pomegranate, athletes, and functional performance variables.</li><li><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:</strong> Studies were included if they involved sportsmen or athletes, focused on pomegranate supplementation, were peer-reviewed original articles published in English, and reported outcomes related to performance and physiology. Studies on other populations, interventions, or those not meeting the peer-review criteria were excluded.</li><li><strong>Study Selection:</strong> After removing duplicates, titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full-text reviews. Reference lists of included studies were also examined for additional relevant research. The selection process adhered to PRISMA guidelines.</li><li><strong>Data Extraction and Analysis:</strong> Data extraction was performed by two independent researchers, focusing on study characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures related to perceptual factors, oxidative stress, inflammation, and functional performance. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression.</li><li><strong>Quality Assessment:</strong> The Cochrane criteria were used to assess the risk of bias in included studies, considering blinding, allocation concealment, selective outcome reporting, and incomplete outcome data.</li><li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> While ethical clearance wasn&#39;t required for this review, care was taken to ensure ethical data extraction and reporting practices.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Search Strategy</strong>
        <p>The use of multiple databases, PICO format, PRISMA guidelines, and MeSH terms demonstrates a thorough and systematic approach to identifying relevant literature, minimizing the risk of publication bias.</p>
        <div class="quote">"A systematic search was carried out using several online literature databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and Ovid..." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Rigorous Quality Assessment</strong>
        <p>Employing the Cochrane criteria for quality assessment ensures that the included studies are evaluated for potential biases, increasing the reliability and validity of the review&#39;s findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Using the Cochrane criteria, a methodical evaluation of bias in the included studies was carried out (Higgins, 2008)." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Data Extraction Discrepancy Resolution</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions that discrepancies between reviewers were reconciled, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the specific process used to resolve these discrepancies when a third reviewer was involved.</p>
        <div class="quote">"By making reference to the original articles, differences in the data collection methods between the two reviewers were reconciled." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more detail on the discrepancy resolution process would enhance the transparency and rigor of the data extraction process.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Describe the specific steps taken when a third reviewer was consulted, such as whether a consensus was reached through discussion or a predefined decision rule was applied.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specify Software for Meta-Regression</strong>
        <p>The section mentions meta-regression but doesn&#39;t specify the software used. Clarifying this would enhance reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To look into sources of heterogeneity and find possible outcome modifiers, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specifying the software used for meta-regression allows other researchers to replicate the analysis and verify the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> State the software used for meta-regression alongside Review Manager 5.4.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of pomegranate supplementation. It details the study selection process, participant characteristics, interventions used, and outcomes related to various physiological markers. The results highlight the potential benefits of pomegranate supplementation on antioxidant status, cardiovascular health, muscle recovery, and satiety, while also acknowledging inconsistencies across studies and the need for further research.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Selection:</strong> From an initial pool of 4401 articles, 23 studies were selected for inclusion based on pre-defined criteria. The PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 2) illustrates the screening and selection procedure.</li><li><strong>Participant Characteristics:</strong> The 23 included studies involved a total of 507 participants, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 55. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of each study, including country, study design, intervention and control groups, dosage and duration of pomegranate supplementation, and variables measured.</li><li><strong>Intervention and Outcomes:</strong> The studies utilized various forms of pomegranate supplementation, primarily juice and extract, at different dosages and durations. The outcomes assessed included markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, muscle damage, cardiovascular health, satiety, and functional performance. The results varied across studies, with some showing significant improvements in certain markers while others reported no significant effects.</li><li><strong>Meta-Analysis Findings:</strong> A meta-analysis of 12 studies revealed significant differences between pomegranate supplementation and placebo groups for AST, HDL, MDA, SBP, and DBP. However, significant heterogeneity was observed for some outcomes. Forest plots were used to visualize the results and assess heterogeneity (Fig. 3).</li><li><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment:</strong> Most of the included studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias concerning blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias (Fig. 4).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Reporting</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive account of the study selection process, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes, allowing for a thorough understanding of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The characteristics of the 23 studies with pomegranate supplementation have been summarized in Table 2." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Visual Representation of Data</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of figures (PRISMA flow chart and forest plots) enhances the clarity and accessibility of the results, making it easier to grasp the overall findings and assess heterogeneity.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Fig. 2 shows an overview of the article screening and selection procedure." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong>
        <p>Assessing the risk of bias in included studies strengthens the validity and reliability of the review&#39;s conclusions.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Most of the included studies had a low risk of bias with respect to blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias (Fig. 4)." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Effect Sizes</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions significant differences for some outcomes, it would be beneficial to consistently report effect sizes (e.g., mean differences, standardized mean differences) for all analyzed variables. This would provide a more precise measure of the magnitude of pomegranate&#39;s effects.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The fixed mean difference for these studies also showed a significant difference between pomegranate supplementation and placebo groups (5.45; 95 % CI, 4.98, 5.92) as presented in Fig. 3." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantifying effect sizes allows for a better understanding of the practical significance of the findings and facilitates comparisons across different studies and outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include effect sizes and their confidence intervals for all reported outcomes in Table 2 and the text describing the meta-analysis results.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Heterogeneity Interpretation</strong>
        <p>The section mentions significant heterogeneity for some outcomes but doesn&#39;t always provide a clear interpretation of its implications. Elaborating on the potential sources and impact of heterogeneity would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Two studies in the forest plot compared the difference in AST among pomegranate supplementation and placebo groups that showed significant difference in heterogeneity among the groups with 97 % I2 value." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing the potential reasons for heterogeneity (e.g., differences in study populations, interventions, or outcome measures) and its impact on the interpretation of the results would enhance the rigor of the analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a brief discussion of the potential sources and implications of heterogeneity for outcomes with high I2 values. Consider exploring potential moderators through subgroup analysis or meta-regression.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>In-depth analysis of findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion goes beyond simply reporting the results and delves into the potential mechanisms and implications of pomegranate supplementation on various physiological parameters.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This possibility for increased vasodilation after polyphenol supplementation may facilitate the transport of nutrients to skeletal muscle and encourage the excretion of harmful metabolic byproducts, which may have consequences for speeding up muscle recovery (Hellsten, Nyberg, Jensen, &amp; Mortensen, 2012)." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Contextualization with existing literature</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively integrates the findings with previous research, providing a broader context for understanding the role of pomegranate supplementation in exercise performance and recovery.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Similar to our findings, GimÂ´enez-Bastida et al. (2021) in a critical systematic review reported the health benefits of pomegranate juices and extracts beyond nutrition." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Address inconsistent findings more directly</strong>
        <p>While the discussion acknowledges mixed findings, it could benefit from a more direct and critical analysis of the discrepancies between studies. This would strengthen the interpretation of the results and provide clearer guidance for future research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Additionally, selected studies (Machin et al., 2014; Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2017; Rosenblat et al., 2010; Stockton &amp; Al-Dujaili, 2022; Trombold et al., 2011) investigated the effects of pomegranate supplementation on exercise performance, recovery, and muscle soreness, with mixed findings." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more critical analysis of inconsistent findings would enhance the scientific rigor of the discussion and provide a more nuanced perspective on the effects of pomegranate supplementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Devote a specific paragraph to analyzing the discrepancies between studies, exploring potential reasons for the inconsistencies, such as differences in study design, participant characteristics, pomegranate dosage and form, and outcome measures.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more specific recommendations for future research</strong>
        <p>The discussion mentions the need for further research but could benefit from more specific recommendations. This would guide future studies and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of pomegranate&#39;s effects.</p>
        <div class="quote">"By highlighting both the potential benefits and areas requiring further investigation, this study provides valuable guidance for future research and clinical practice in the field of pomegranate supplementation and its effects on physiological parameters." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specific recommendations would make the discussion more actionable and facilitate the development of well-designed studies that address the current gaps in knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide concrete suggestions for future research, such as specific research questions to address, optimal study designs to employ, standardized protocols for pomegranate supplementation (dosage, form, duration), and specific populations to target.</p>

            <li>There are no numerical values presented in this figure. The key information lies in the depiction of the proposed molecular mechanisms and the interactions between different molecules.</li><li>The significance of these interactions lies in their potential to explain the observed effects of pomegranate supplementation on vasodilation and exercise performance. By scavenging ROS, pomegranate may protect NO from degradation, thereby promoting vasodilation and potentially enhancing blood flow to muscles during exercise.</li><li>The relationships between the different molecules depicted in the figure are crucial for understanding the proposed mechanism. ROS can scavenge NO, reducing its bioavailability for vasodilation. Pomegranate&#39;s antioxidant properties may counteract this process by scavenging ROS, thereby preserving NO and promoting vasodilation. SOD and GPX are enzymes involved in the detoxification of ROS, and their activity may be influenced by pomegranate supplementation.</li><li>The proposed mechanism depicted in the figure aligns with the broader scientific context of the role of ROS and NO in vascular function and exercise physiology. ROS are known to play a role in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and muscle contraction, but excessive ROS production can lead to oxidative stress and impair NO bioavailability. Pomegranate&#39;s antioxidant properties may have implications for modulating these processes and improving exercise performance.</li></ul></div>

                <p>This figure provides a visual summary of the purported promising effects of pomegranate supplementation. It uses a human silhouette with icons and text boxes to illustrate the potential benefits in two main categories: effects related to exercise and general health effects. A central image of a pomegranate connects to these two categories. The exercise-related effects include improved performance, faster muscle recovery, ROS-mediated NO scavenging, improved physical fitness, decreased blood pressure, and prevention of oxidative destruction. The general health effects include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, along with changes in various biomarkers (SOD, GPX, MMP2, MMP9, ceruloplasmin, MDA).</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Using a visual summary can be helpful for communicating key findings to a broad audience. However, this type of figure lacks the detail and precision needed for a rigorous scientific discussion. It&#39;s important to remember that this figure represents a summary of purported effects, not a presentation of direct evidence.</li><li>The figure provides a general overview of the potential benefits of pomegranate supplementation, but it lacks specific details about the studies supporting these claims. It doesn&#39;t specify the form of pomegranate used (juice, extract, etc.), the dosage, or the duration of supplementation. Furthermore, it doesn&#39;t differentiate between effects observed in different populations (e.g., athletes, healthy individuals, patients with specific conditions). More detailed information and references to supporting studies are needed to enhance transparency.</li><li>The reference text simply states that the promising effects are &quot;shown in Fig. 6.&quot; This is not a valid form of scientific evidence. The figure itself doesn&#39;t present any data or results from specific studies. The claims made in the figure need to be supported by evidence presented elsewhere in the paper or by citing relevant external studies.</li><li>While the figure is visually appealing, it doesn&#39;t adhere to standard scientific conventions for presenting research findings. It relies on general statements and icons rather than data and statistical analysis. A more rigorous approach would involve presenting the evidence supporting each claim in a more structured and detailed manner.</li></ul></div>

            <div class="critique-title">Presentation Critique</div>
            <ul>
            <li>The figure is visually appealing and easy to understand at a basic level. The use of icons and simple language makes it accessible to a broad audience. However, the lack of specific details and references limits its value for a scientific audience. The terms used, while generally understandable, could benefit from more precise definitions. For example, &quot;ROS-mediated NO scavenging&quot; is mentioned but not fully explained.</li><li>The visual organization is clear and logical, using a central image of a pomegranate to connect the two main categories of effects. The use of icons is helpful, but some icons could be more informative and visually distinct. The text boxes are clearly organized, but the use of different font sizes and styles could improve readability.</li><li>The figure is likely intended for a broad audience, including both experts and the general public. However, the lack of scientific rigor and detailed information makes it less suitable for a scientific audience. For the general public, the simplified presentation might create an overly optimistic impression of the benefits of pomegranate supplementation without providing sufficient context or caveats.</li><li>The figure&#39;s presentation style prioritizes visual appeal over scientific accuracy and detail. It doesn&#39;t adhere to standard conventions for presenting scientific information, such as including data, statistical analysis, or specific references to supporting studies.</li></ul></div>
