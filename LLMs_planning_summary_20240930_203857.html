        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This research paper evaluates the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), focusing on OpenAI&#39;s o1 model, using the PlanBench benchmark, which features block-stacking problems. The study reveals that while LLMs have made limited progress in planning, o1 demonstrates significant improvement due to its approximate reasoning abilities as opposed to the approximate retrieval approach of LLMs. However, o1&#39;s performance isn&#39;t perfect, particularly with complex or longer problems, highlighting the need for further research in LRM architecture and evaluation methodologies. The study emphasizes that evaluating LRMs requires considering not only accuracy but also efficiency, cost, and guarantees, which are critical for practical applications.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>LLMs struggle with planning: Even advanced LLMs show limited success on PlanBench, particularly with variations like &#39;Mystery Blocksworld,&#39; which uses obfuscated language. This suggests that LLMs rely on pattern recognition rather than true understanding, highlighting their limitations in reasoning and planning compared to retrieval tasks. The best LLM only achieves around 62.6% accuracy on standard Blocksworld, demonstrating substantial room for improvement.</li><li>o1 demonstrates improved planning abilities: o1, categorized as an LRM, exhibits significantly better performance on PlanBench compared to LLMs, including the challenging &#39;Mystery Blocksworld.&#39; This improvement suggests that o1&#39;s approximate reasoning approach is more effective than the approximate retrieval used by LLMs. For instance, o1 achieves nearly perfect accuracy (close to 100%) on standard Blocksworld with shorter plans.</li><li>o1&#39;s performance degrades with problem complexity: While o1 excels at simpler Blocksworld problems, its accuracy drops as the required plan length increases or when dealing with unsolvable instances. This indicates limitations in o1&#39;s reasoning capabilities when faced with more complex scenarios. For example, its accuracy decreases to around 23.63% on Blocksworld problems requiring 20 or more steps.</li><li>o1 faces challenges with unsolvable problems: o1 can sometimes identify unsolvable Blocksworld instances, but not consistently. It can either propose impossible plans or incorrectly label solvable problems as unsolvable, suggesting further development is needed to improve its handling of such scenarios. For instance, it correctly identifies only 27% of unsolvable Blocksworld instances while falsely labeling 0% of solvable ones as unsolvable.</li><li>LRMs have higher computational costs: o1, while demonstrating improved performance, incurs significantly higher computational costs compared to LLMs. This raises concerns about its practical deployment and necessitates considering cost-effectiveness when evaluating different planning approaches. Table 4 shows o1-preview costing $42.12 per 100 instances compared to GPT-4 Turbo&#39;s $1.2.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Clear distinction between LLMs and LRMs: The paper clearly differentiates between LLMs (approximate retrievers) and LRMs (approximate reasoners), providing a conceptual framework for understanding their distinct capabilities and limitations in planning. This distinction highlights the significance of o1&#39;s different approach.</li><li>Comprehensive performance analysis: The paper offers a detailed analysis of o1&#39;s performance on PlanBench, considering various factors such as problem size, obfuscation, and unsolvability. This thorough evaluation provides valuable insights into o1&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, facilitating a deeper understanding of its reasoning capabilities.</li><li>Emphasis on practical considerations: The study doesn&#39;t solely focus on accuracy but also addresses critical practical considerations such as computational cost and the lack of guarantees associated with LRMs. This broader perspective is essential for real-world applications where efficiency and reliability are paramount.</li><li>Use of established benchmark: Employing the PlanBench benchmark allows for a consistent evaluation of different models and facilitates comparison with previous research. This strengthens the study&#39;s validity and allows for tracking progress in the field of AI planning.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Deeper investigation of o1&#39;s reasoning process: While the paper speculates on o1&#39;s architecture, a more detailed analysis of its internal reasoning would be beneficial. Analyzing intermediate steps or reasoning traces (if available) could reveal how o1 generates solutions and handles unsolvable problems. This would facilitate targeted improvements to the model&#39;s architecture and training.</li><li>Comparison with other reasoning approaches: Comparing o1&#39;s performance with alternative reasoning methods like symbolic planners or hybrid approaches would provide a broader context for evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. This comparison would help identify scenarios where alternative approaches might be more suitable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significant Elements</h3>
        
    <div>
        <h4>Table 2</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Table 2 compares the performance (accuracy and time) of o1, other LLMs, and a classical planner (Fast Downward) on various Blocksworld tasks. It shows that while o1 outperforms LLMs, it&#39;s not as fast or accurate as Fast Downward, highlighting the trade-off between general-purpose models and specialized systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table underscores the performance gap between LRMs and dedicated planning systems, highlighting the need for further research to bridge this gap and improve LRM efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h4>Figure 3</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Figure 3 depicts the decrease in o1&#39;s accuracy as the length of the required plan increases in Blocksworld. It visually demonstrates the model&#39;s limitations in handling more complex problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure visually reinforces the key finding that o1&#39;s reasoning abilities struggle with increased problem complexity, highlighting a crucial area for future development.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This research paper demonstrates that while Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 represent a significant advancement over LLMs in planning tasks, challenges remain, particularly in handling complex problems and unsolvable instances. o1&#39;s improved performance comes at a higher computational cost, emphasizing the need to consider efficiency alongside accuracy in practical applications. Future research should focus on developing more robust LRM architectures that can efficiently handle longer plans and unsolvable problems, exploring hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of LLMs/LRMs with dedicated solvers, and developing more comprehensive evaluation methods that consider accuracy, efficiency, and guarantees. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of LRM reasoning processes and error analysis will be crucial for refining these models and unlocking their full potential in real-world planning scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for evaluating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), specifically OpenAI&#39;s o1, using the PlanBench benchmark. It emphasizes the shift from approximate retrieval in LLMs to approximate reasoning in LRMs, highlighting o1&#39;s potential and the need for new evaluation methods.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>PlanBench&#39;s Role:</strong> PlanBench serves as a tool to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs and now LRMs, providing a consistent measure of progress.</li><li><strong>LRM vs. LLM:</strong> The introduction distinguishes between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), suggesting o1 belongs to the latter category due to its different architecture and capabilities.</li><li><strong>o1 as an Approximate Reasoner:</strong> Unlike LLMs, which are described as approximate retrievers, o1 is presented as an approximate reasoner, implying a more sophisticated approach to problem-solving.</li><li><strong>Need for New Evaluation Tools:</strong> The unique nature of LRMs like o1 requires new evaluation tools and methods, especially given the limited information about their internal workings.</li><li><strong>Extending PlanBench:</strong> The introduction foreshadows the need to extend PlanBench to better assess the capabilities of LRMs and address questions of efficiency, cost, and guarantees.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Distinction between LLMs and LRMs</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly differentiates between LLMs and LRMs, highlighting the shift from retrieval to reasoning.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In particular, unlike the LLMs which came before it, which can roughly be viewed as approximate retrievers, o1 seems to have been trained to be an approximate reasoner." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Justification for New Evaluation Methods</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively justifies the need for new evaluation methods for LRMs by emphasizing their unique characteristics.</p>
        <div class="quote">"To properly evaluate this new kind of model and understand its abilities and limitations will require new tools and evaluation methods, especially if details of the overall model structure are kept secret and internal traces remain inaccessible to outside researchers." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>More Concrete Examples of o1&#39;s Reasoning</strong>
        <p>While the introduction states that o1 is an approximate reasoner, providing specific examples of its reasoning process would strengthen the argument.</p>

            <h3>State-of-the-Art LLMs Still Can’t Plan</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section examines the performance of existing Large Language Models (LLMs) on the PlanBench benchmark, particularly focusing on block-stacking problems. It finds that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with these planning tasks, especially variations like &quot;Mystery Blocksworld,&quot; suggesting their limitations in reasoning and planning compared to retrieval tasks.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>PlanBench Performance:</strong> LLMs show limited success on PlanBench, even with simpler block-stacking problems.</li><li><strong>Mystery Blocksworld:</strong> LLMs perform poorly on this obfuscated version of Blocksworld, highlighting their difficulty with semantic understanding.</li><li><strong>Translation and Reasoning:</strong> Providing explicit translations between problem representations doesn&#39;t significantly improve LLM performance, suggesting a lack of compositional reasoning abilities.</li><li><strong>One-Shot vs. Zero-Shot Prompting:</strong> One-shot prompting doesn&#39;t consistently improve performance over zero-shot prompting, and can even be detrimental for some models.</li><li><strong>Accuracy Limitations:</strong> The best-performing LLM achieves only around 62.6% accuracy on standard Blocksworld, indicating substantial room for improvement.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Performance Comparison</strong>
        <p>The section provides a clear comparison of different LLMs on various Blocksworld tasks, allowing for a direct assessment of their capabilities.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In Table 1, we present the results of running current and previous generation LLMs on a static test set of 600 three to five block Blocksworld problems, as well as on a set of 600 semantically identical but syntactically obfuscated instances which we call Mystery Blocksworld." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Highlighting Limitations</strong>
        <p>The section effectively highlights the limitations of LLMs in planning, emphasizing the gap between their performance and the desired level of competence.</p>
        <div class="quote">"PlanBench remains a challenging benchmark for vanilla LLMs (massive transformer models which have been fine-tuned via RLHF), and their lackluster performance on even our easiest test set leads us to continue to believe that planning cannot be generally and robustly solved by approximate retrieval alone." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate Reasons for One-Shot Degradation</strong>
        <p>The section notes that one-shot prompting can worsen performance but doesn&#39;t delve into the reasons behind this.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We also find that, contrary to previous claims, one-shot prompting is not a strict improvement over zero-shot. In fact, for many models it seems to do significantly worse!" (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding why one-shot prompting sometimes fails could lead to better prompting strategies or model improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the specific cases where one-shot prompting performs worse, looking for patterns in the prompts or the model&#39;s responses.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explore Alternative Obfuscation Methods</strong>
        <p>The Mystery Blocksworld obfuscation might be too brittle or easily reversed by LLMs.</p>

            <h3>From Approximate Retrieval to Approximate Reasoning: Evaluating o1</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses the shift from approximate retrieval (like looking up answers in a vast library) in Large Language Models (LLMs) to approximate reasoning (like figuring things out step-by-step) in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), using OpenAI&#39;s o1 as a prime example. It evaluates o1&#39;s performance on PlanBench, a benchmark for planning tasks, and finds that while o1 shows significant improvement over LLMs, its performance isn&#39;t perfect and degrades with more complex problems.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Approximate Retrieval vs. Approximate Reasoning:</strong> LLMs retrieve information like searching a database, while LRMs attempt to reason through problems step-by-step.</li><li><strong>o1&#39;s Architecture and Operation:</strong> o1 likely combines a large language model with a system that guides its reasoning process, possibly using reinforcement learning.</li><li><strong>PlanBench Evaluation:</strong> o1 performs well on basic block-stacking problems in PlanBench, exceeding LLMs, but struggles with more complex or obfuscated versions.</li><li><strong>Accuracy with Increased Problem Size:</strong> o1&#39;s accuracy drops significantly when the block-stacking problems require longer plans, indicating limitations in its reasoning abilities.</li><li><strong>Performance on Unsolvable Instances:</strong> o1 can sometimes identify unsolvable problems, but also makes mistakes, either by proposing impossible plans or incorrectly claiming solvable problems are unsolvable.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Explanation of LLM Limitations</strong>
        <p>The section effectively explains why traditional LLMs struggle with planning tasks, using the analogy of approximate retrieval to illustrate their limitations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Many researchers, including us, have argued that &quot;standard&quot; autoregressive LLMs generate outputs via approximate retrieval, and that, while they show impressive performance on a range of System 1 tasks, they are unlikely to achieve more System 2-like approximate reasoning capabilities critical for planning tasks (c.f. [9])." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Performance Analysis of o1</strong>
        <p>The section provides a comprehensive analysis of o1&#39;s performance on various PlanBench tasks, including different problem sizes and unsolvable instances.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Evaluating LRMs on the Original Test Set: We test o1-preview and o1-mini on the static PlanBench test set." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Further Investigation of o1&#39;s Reasoning Process</strong>
        <p>While the section speculates about o1&#39;s architecture, a deeper investigation of its internal reasoning process would be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As far as we can tell, o1 combines an underlying LLM, most likely a modified GPT-4o, into an RL-trained system that steers the creation, curation, and final selection of private Chain-of-Thought reasoning traces." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding how o1 reasons would help identify its strengths and weaknesses, leading to better model development.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Analyze the intermediate steps or reasoning traces (if accessible) to understand how o1 arrives at its solutions or identifies unsolvable problems.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comparison with Other Reasoning Approaches</strong>
        <p>Comparing o1&#39;s performance with other reasoning methods, such as symbolic planners or hybrid approaches, would provide a broader context.</p>
        <div class="quote">"in what are called LLM-Modulo systems [10, 11]. o1 attempts to supplement an underlying LLM with System 2-like abilities in a different way." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This comparison would help assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of different reasoning approaches for planning tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Evaluate the performance of symbolic planners or LLM-Modulo systems on the same PlanBench tasks used to evaluate o1, and compare their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</p>

        <summary>figure 1</summary>
        <p>Figure 1 shows two line graphs comparing the performance of different models on the &#39;Mystery Blocksworld&#39; task. One graph represents &#39;zero-shot&#39; performance (no prior example given), and the other shows &#39;one-shot&#39; performance (one example provided). The x-axis of each graph represents the length of the solution plan (number of steps), and the y-axis represents the percentage of problems solved correctly. Each line on the graphs corresponds to a different model, and you can see how their accuracy changes as the plans get longer. Generally, the lines slope downwards, meaning accuracy drops as the problems get harder (longer plans needed).</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This figure is introduced at the beginning of the &#39;From Approximate Retrieval to Approximate Reasoning: Evaluating o1&#39; section on page 3. It visually demonstrates the performance difference between LLMs, LRMs (o1-preview and o1-mini), and a classical planner (Fast Downward) on the Mystery Blocksworld task, highlighting the relative effectiveness of the LRMs compared to LLMs and their limitations compared to Fast Downward.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This figure is important because it visually shows that the new &#39;reasoning&#39; models (LRMs) perform much better than standard language models (LLMs) on the tricky &#39;Mystery Blocksworld&#39; task. It also shows that even these new models aren&#39;t perfect and struggle with longer, more complex problems. This supports the idea that while LRMs are a step forward, there&#39;s still a lot of room for improvement in planning and reasoning.</p>

        <p>Table 3 shows how well OpenAI&#39;s o1-preview model can tell if a block-stacking problem is impossible to solve. It looks at two types of problems: regular &#39;Blocksworld&#39; and a more complicated version called &#39;Randomized Mystery Blocksworld&#39;. The table tells us two things: 1. The &#39;True Negative&#39; rate: how often the model correctly says a problem is impossible when it actually is. 2. The &#39;False Negative&#39; rate: how often the model wrongly says a problem is impossible when it actually has a solution. Think of it like a medical test - you want it to correctly identify the sick people (true negative) and not misdiagnose healthy people as sick (false negative).</p>

            <p><strong>Text:</strong> "Table 3: Rate of claiming that a problem is impossible by OpenAI’s ol-preview on 100 unsolvable and 600 solvable instances in the Blocksworld and Randomized Mystery Blocksworld domains. The True Negative rate is the percent of unsolvable instances that were correctly marked as unsolvable. The False Negative rate is the percent of solvable instances that were incorrectly marked as unsolvable. Previous models are not shown in this table as their true negative and false negative rates were generally 0% across the board."</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This table appears on page 5, within the section discussing o1&#39;s evaluation. It follows the discussion of o1-preview&#39;s performance on larger Blocksworld problems and precedes the analysis of accuracy/cost tradeoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This table is important because it shows a new aspect of o1-preview&#39;s abilities - figuring out when a problem can&#39;t be solved at all. This is useful in real-world situations where knowing something is impossible is just as important as finding a solution.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This conclusion summarizes the findings of the study, highlighting the improved performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs like OpenAI&#39;s o1) compared to traditional LLMs on planning tasks using the PlanBench benchmark. While LLMs showed some progress on basic Blocksworld problems, they struggled with more complex or obfuscated versions. LRMs, particularly o1, demonstrated significantly better accuracy but still faced limitations with longer problems and unsolvable instances. The conclusion also emphasizes the importance of considering accuracy/efficiency trade-offs and the lack of correctness guarantees with LRMs, suggesting alternative approaches like LLM-Modulo systems or dedicated solvers for certain applications.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>LLM Progress:</strong> LLMs have shown limited improvement on standard Blocksworld problems, reaching a maximum accuracy of around 62.5%.</li><li><strong>Mystery Blocksworld Performance:</strong> LLMs performed poorly on the obfuscated Mystery Blocksworld, revealing their reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true understanding.</li><li><strong>LRM (o1) Performance:</strong> LRMs, especially o1, demonstrated substantially better accuracy on both standard and Mystery Blocksworld, indicating improved reasoning abilities.</li><li><strong>Limitations of LRMs:</strong> Despite improvements, o1&#39;s performance degraded with longer problems and unsolvable instances, highlighting remaining challenges.</li><li><strong>Accuracy/Efficiency Trade-offs:</strong> The conclusion emphasizes the need to consider the computational cost and lack of guarantees associated with LRMs when comparing them to other approaches.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Concise Summary of Findings</strong>
        <p>The conclusion effectively summarizes the key findings of the study, highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and LRMs.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We took a fresh look at the planning capabilities of both SOTA LLMs, and examined the performance of OpenAI’s new o1 models on PlanBench. Over time, LLMs have improved their performance on vanilla Blocksworld–with the best performing model, LlaMA 3.1 405B, reaching 62.5% accuracy." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Practical Considerations</strong>
        <p>The conclusion goes beyond simply reporting accuracy and discusses important practical considerations like efficiency, cost, and guarantees.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We also discussed the critical accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs that are brought up by the fact that o1 that uses (and charges for) significant inference-time compute, as well as how it compares to other LLM-based approaches (such as LLM-Modulo [10]) and dedicated solvers." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Future Research Directions</strong>
        <p>While the conclusion briefly mentions future evaluations, it could expand on specific research directions to address the identified limitations.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We hope this research note gives a good snapshot of the planning capabilities of LLMs and LRMs as well as useful suggestions for realistically evaluating them." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more concrete future research directions would strengthen the conclusion&#39;s impact and guide further work in the field.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Suggest specific research areas like developing new LRM architectures that address the limitations with longer problems and unsolvable instances, or exploring hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of LLMs/LRMs with dedicated solvers.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Deeper Analysis of LRM Errors</strong>
        <p>The conclusion notes o1&#39;s limitations but could provide a deeper analysis of the types of errors it makes and their potential causes.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Encouraged by this, we have also evaluated o1’s performance on longer problems and unsolvable instances, and found that these accuracy gains are not general or robust." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed error analysis would provide valuable insights into the nature of LRM reasoning and guide future model improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Categorize the errors made by o1, such as incorrect action sequences, failure to recognize unsolvability, or exceeding computational limits. Investigate whether these errors are due to limitations in the model&#39;s architecture, training data, or reasoning process.</p>
