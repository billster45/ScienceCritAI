        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This paper proposes a Mobility Digital Twin (MDT) framework to improve mobility services by creating a digital replica of the transportation ecosystem. This framework includes digital representations of humans, vehicles, and traffic, interacting in real-time with their physical counterparts through a cloud-edge-device architecture. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS), the framework supports real-time monitoring, modeling, and prediction to improve existing and future mobility services. A personalized adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system demonstrates the MDT&#39;s practical application. The framework&#39;s potential to improve services by incorporating personalized data and real-time feedback is significant, and the paper also addresses future challenges like standardization and AI integration.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The MDT framework effectively integrates data from human, vehicle, and traffic digital twins. This integration enables a holistic view of the transportation system, allowing for more informed decision-making and personalized services. The connection between the physical and digital entities is established through a cloud-edge-device communication plane, enabling real-time data exchange and synchronization. This constant feedback loop ensures that the digital twin accurately reflects the current state of the physical system and enables timely interventions or adjustments. For example, real-time driver behavior data can be combined with current traffic conditions and vehicle status to provide personalized guidance and improve safety.</li><li>The P-ACC case study demonstrates a significant improvement over traditional ACC systems. By incorporating personalized driver behavior models learned using Max-Ent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), the P-ACC system reduced driver takeover events by 86.4%. Takeover events, where the driver has to manually intervene due to discomfort with the system&#39;s performance, are a key indicator of ACC effectiveness. This reduction highlights the P-ACC&#39;s ability to provide a more comfortable and reliable driving experience. This improvement was measured by comparing the takeover percentages in real-world driving tests with a Lexus LS vehicle equipped with both P-ACC and traditional ACC. The lower takeover rate with P-ACC demonstrates its practical value in enhancing driving experience and potentially safety.</li><li>The proposed cloud-edge architecture, built on AWS, supports real-time data processing and model inference. The latency analysis revealed that the cloud computing and downlink latency remained relatively constant at around 16 seconds, even with increasing data frequencies. While the uplink latency increased with data volume, the constant processing time in the cloud suggests efficient resource allocation and scalability. This performance is crucial for real-time applications like P-ACC, where timely feedback and control adjustments are essential. This finding is important because it demonstrates the feasibility of deploying complex, data-driven algorithms in a real-time setting for mobility applications.</li><li>Driver classification within the Human Digital Twin utilizes real-time data and the MOVESTAR model. This classification system categorizes drivers based on their driving scores across various dimensions like safety, comfort, and eco-friendliness. This allows for personalized feedback and tailored recommendations. For instance, a driver classified as &#39;reckless&#39; might receive more frequent safety alerts or incentives for improving their driving behavior. This personalized approach has the potential to improve overall road safety and promote more efficient driving practices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The clear definition of the MDT framework and its three planes (physical, digital, communication) provides a strong conceptual foundation. This structured approach facilitates understanding of the complex interactions between the physical and digital worlds. By explicitly outlining the roles of each plane and their building blocks, the paper lays the groundwork for a practical implementation of the Digital Twin concept in the mobility domain. This clarity is crucial for researchers and developers building upon this framework.</li><li>The use of established technologies like AWS, Kafka, and Spark ensures the reliability and scalability of the proposed architecture. These widely adopted technologies provide a robust foundation for building and deploying complex systems like the MDT framework. Leveraging these existing tools also reduces development time and effort, allowing researchers to focus on the novel aspects of the MDT framework. This practical approach strengthens the paper&#39;s contribution by providing a readily implementable solution.</li><li>The P-ACC case study provides a compelling demonstration of the MDT framework&#39;s practical value. By showing how the framework can be applied to a real-world problem and achieving measurable improvements, the paper strengthens its impact and relevance. The quantitative results, particularly the significant reduction in driver takeover events, provide concrete evidence of the P-ACC&#39;s effectiveness. This real-world validation enhances the credibility of the MDT framework and encourages further exploration of its potential applications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>While the architecture uses an edge layer, its specific role and implementation could be further clarified. Providing more details on the hardware and software used for edge computing would strengthen the technical aspects of the paper. Future research could explore different edge computing paradigms and their impact on system performance. A more detailed discussion of how data is processed and managed at the edge would also be valuable.</li><li>The paper lacks a thorough discussion of security and privacy considerations. Given the sensitivity of mobility data, addressing these issues is crucial for real-world deployment. Future work should explore security measures at each layer of the architecture, including data encryption, access control, and intrusion detection. Additionally, privacy-preserving techniques, such as data anonymization and differential privacy, should be considered to protect user information.</li>
        </ul>

The framework integrates digital twins of humans, vehicles, and traffic, enabling real-time data exchange and personalized services. The P-ACC case study demonstrates the framework&#39;s practical effectiveness by significantly reducing driver takeover events compared to traditional ACC. While the architecture and case study showcase the MDT&#39;s potential, future research should address security and privacy concerns, further investigate the role of edge computing, and explore the framework&#39;s generalizability to diverse traffic scenarios and vehicle types. Continued development in these areas will pave the way for broader adoption and unlock the full potential of MDT technology to revolutionize transportation systems.</p>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Overview</strong>
        <p>The literature review provides a comprehensive overview of relevant research on cloud computing and Digital Twins in transportation, covering various applications and highlighting the limitations of existing approaches.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The Digital Twin concept has been loosely defined and adopted in the transportation domain since its emergence, partly due to its similarity and connection with other technologies." (Page 4)</div>

            <h3>Mobility Digital Twin Concept</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section introduces the Mobility Digital Twin (MDT) framework, which consists of three interconnected planes: the physical space (human, vehicle, traffic), the digital space (digital replicas), and the communication plane facilitating data exchange between them. The MDT leverages IoT technologies to connect these entities, enabling real-time data flow and synchronization. The section details the functions of each plane and their building blocks, emphasizing the importance of the communication plane in maintaining synchronization between the physical and digital worlds.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Communication Plane:</strong> This plane enables real-time and non-real-time data flow between the physical and digital spaces, crucial for the synchronization that defines a Digital Twin. It allows for data sampling in the physical world to be processed in the digital world and then acted upon in the physical world.</li><li><strong>Physical Space:</strong> This space encompasses the human, vehicle, and traffic elements, focusing on sampling data through sensors and actuating commands received from the digital space. It emphasizes minimal onboard computing, as most processing occurs in the digital space.</li><li><strong>Digital Space:</strong> This space houses the digital replicas and performs storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction using data from the physical space. The data lake is a key component, enabling centralized storage and sharing of structured and unstructured data.</li><li><strong>Human, Vehicle, and Traffic Building Blocks:</strong> Each building block in the physical space has a corresponding Digital Twin in the digital space. This allows for specialized data processing and microservices tailored to each entity (e.g., driver classification in Human Digital Twin, predictive maintenance in Vehicle Digital Twin, traffic flow monitoring in Traffic Digital Twin).</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Framework Description</strong>
        <p>The section clearly describes the MDT framework and its three planes, providing a good understanding of the overall concept and the interactions between the physical and digital worlds.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The MDT framework proposed in this study, as shown in Fig. 1, consists of three planes: 1) the lower plane, highlighted in yellow, stands for the physical space where human beings, vehicles, and traffic infrastructures reside; 2) the upper plane, highlighted in blue, represents the digital space where the digital replicas of those physical entities are located at; and 3) between these two planes, the communication plane (in gray) plays a crucial role in this framework to allow real-time and nonreal-time data streaming for both upstream and downstream." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Explanation of Components</strong>
        <p>The section provides a detailed explanation of the building blocks within each plane, including their functions and how they contribute to the overall framework.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Three entities are considered in this MDT framework: Human, Vehicle, and Traffic. Given the existence of the communication plane, each of the entity can be connected to the digital space (e.g., Internet) and exchanges data with each other." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Synchronization</strong>
        <p>The section emphasizes the importance of the communication plane in maintaining synchronization between the physical and digital spaces, which is a crucial aspect of the Digital Twin concept.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The major difference between a Digital Twin framework with an iteration framework, or a model-based design framework is that, a Digital Twin framework always maintains synchronized versions of the physical system and its digital counterpart [32]." (Page 5)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>More Concrete Examples of Microservices</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions various potential microservices, providing more concrete examples with specific inputs and outputs would enhance clarity and demonstrate the practical applications of the MDT.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Those data will go through one or multiple processes in the digital space internally, including storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction, and the resulting data are transmitted downstream to the physical space via the communication plane." (Page 5)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Concrete examples would make the potential of the MDT framework more tangible and easier to grasp.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> For instance, describe a microservice that uses real-time traffic data to optimize traffic light timings or a microservice that predicts vehicle maintenance needs based on sensor data.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Data Lake Implementation</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the data lake as a key component but could provide more details on its implementation, such as the type of database used and how data consistency is maintained.</p>
        <div class="quote">"One of the biggest strengths of this MDT framework over traditional mobility system frameworks is the data lake, which is a centralized repository that allows structured or unstructured data at any scale to be stored." (Page 6)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> More details on the data lake implementation would strengthen the technical credibility of the framework.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Specify the database technology used (e.g., NoSQL, distributed database) and discuss how data consistency and integrity are ensured across the different Digital Twins.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Security and Privacy Considerations</strong>
        <p>The section could address security and privacy considerations related to the data exchange and storage within the MDT framework.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Given the sensitive nature of some mobility data, discussing security and privacy aspects is crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible development of the MDT.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph discussing potential security threats and outlining measures to protect data privacy, such as encryption, access control, and data anonymization.</p>

            <h3>Example Architecture with Cloud-Edge Computing</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details an example architecture implementing the MDT framework using cloud and edge computing. It leverages AWS for cloud services and incorporates an edge layer for low-latency processing. The architecture is divided into four layers: cloud, edge, device, and API. The cloud layer handles data storage, analytics, and microservices. The edge layer manages communication, computing, and temporary data caching. The device layer represents real-world entities like vehicles and simulators. The API layer connects the system to external data sources. This architecture enables real-time and batch data processing, supporting the MDT&#39;s functionalities.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Cloud Layer (AWS):</strong> This layer utilizes various AWS services like EKS, Kafka, and S3 to handle real-time processing, data storage, and analytics. It also hosts the AI/ML framework and Digital Twin microservices.</li><li><strong>Edge Layer:</strong> This layer acts as an intermediary between the cloud and devices, managing communication, performing edge computing tasks, and caching data. It uses protocols like HTTPS, MQTT, and Zenoh.</li><li><strong>Device Layer:</strong> This layer represents the physical entities in the MDT framework, including mobile apps, real and RC vehicles, and simulators. It&#39;s responsible for data sampling and command actuation.</li><li><strong>API Layer:</strong> This layer connects the cloud to external APIs, enriching the MDT with data from sources like TomTom, OpenStreetMap, and OpenWeather. It also includes an event query API and a web portal for visualization.</li><li><strong>Four-Layered Architecture:</strong> The architecture&#39;s layered design (cloud, edge, device, API) allows for a clear separation of concerns and enables efficient data flow and processing.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>

    <li>
        <strong>Use of Established Technologies</strong>
        <p>The architecture leverages established technologies like AWS, Kafka, and Spark, ensuring reliability and scalability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"As shown in Fig. 2, the architecture can be divided into four layers: 1) the cloud layer, which is built on AWS and its Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) [57]; 2) the edge layer, which has a computing component, a communication component, and a storage component; 3) the device layer, which generates data and consumes guidance; 4) the API (Application Programming Interface) layer, which hooks up the cloud layer with external APIs." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Layer Definitions</strong>
        <p>The four-layer architecture (cloud, edge, device, API) provides a clear separation of concerns and facilitates understanding of the system&#39;s structure and data flow.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The major purpose of designing this architecture is to accommodate the proposed MDT framework shown in Fig. 1, so the Digital Twin does not just remain in the conceptual phase but can also be deployed in the real world with the help of cloud computing and edge computing."

        <div class="quote">"In this example architecture, an edge layer is designed with three different modules: computing, communication, and storage." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would provide a more concrete understanding of the edge layer&#39;s capabilities and limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Specify the type of edge devices used, their processing power, and the software platform employed for edge computing tasks.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Address Security Considerations</strong>
        <p>The section lacks discussion on security aspects of the architecture, which is crucial for a system handling potentially sensitive data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Security is a critical concern in any cloud-edge architecture, and addressing it would strengthen the proposal.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a paragraph discussing security measures implemented at each layer, such as data encryption, access control, and intrusion detection.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Scalability and Fault Tolerance</strong>
        <p>The architecture should address scalability and fault tolerance, especially given the dynamic nature of mobility data and the distributed nature of the system.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ensuring scalability and fault tolerance is crucial for real-world deployment of the MDT framework.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss how the architecture can handle increasing data volumes and device connections, and how it ensures system resilience in case of component failures.</p>

            <h3>Example Microservices and Case Study</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section details example microservices within each Digital Twin (Human, Vehicle, Traffic) and presents a case study of a Personalized Adaptive Cruise Control (P-ACC) system. The Human Digital Twin demonstrates user management and driver classification. The Vehicle Digital Twin showcases cloud-based ADAS features. The Traffic Digital Twin covers traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limits. The P-ACC case study integrates these microservices, demonstrating improved performance over traditional ACC by incorporating personalized driver behavior, vehicle type, and environmental factors.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Human Digital Twin Microservices:</strong> User management features allow for role-based access control (admin, supervisor, viewer) and human-vehicle association. Driver classification is performed using real-time data and the MOVESTAR model, categorizing drivers based on driving scores (overall, eco, safe, comfort).</li><li><strong>Vehicle Digital Twin Microservices:</strong> Cloud-based ADAS functionalities leverage data from a human-in-the-loop simulation. Machine learning algorithms analyze historical data to predict driver behavior and provide guidance through an AR HUD, displaying information like driving proficiency, potential actions, and mood.</li><li><strong>Traffic Digital Twin Microservices:</strong> Traffic flow monitoring uses data from a mobile app to visualize traffic density and speed on a map. Variable speed limits are implemented using geofences, allowing customized speed recommendations based on location and entry/exit rules.</li><li><strong>P-ACC Case Study Integration:</strong> The P-ACC system integrates microservices from all three Digital Twins, considering driver type, vehicle type, weather, road type, and traffic conditions. It uses Max-Ent IRL to learn personalized driving models and determine desired car-following gaps.</li><li><strong>Real-world P-ACC Evaluation:</strong> Real-world testing with a Lexus LS vehicle demonstrates the P-ACC system&#39;s effectiveness, showing an 86.4% reduction in takeover events compared to traditional ACC. Latency results are also presented, highlighting the time required for model inference.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Microservice Examples</strong>
        <p>The section provides clear examples of microservices for each Digital Twin, illustrating their functionalities and potential applications.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This section first introduces example microservices of each digital building block of the proposed MDT framework, including user management and driver type classification of the Human Digital Twin, cloud-based ADAS of the Vehicle Digital Twin, and traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit of the Traffic Digital Twin." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Case Study</strong>
        <p>The P-ACC case study effectively integrates the microservices and demonstrates the benefits of the MDT framework in a real-world application.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Then, a case study of the P-ACC system is conducted, which integrates aforementioned example microservices into one application." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantitative Results</strong>
        <p>The inclusion of quantitative results, such as the takeover percentage and latency measurements, strengthens the case for the P-ACC system&#39;s effectiveness.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Based on the test results from three different drivers in different environments, the takeover event happens 86.4% less frequently when drivers use the proposed IRL-based P-ACC, compared to a traditional PID-based ACC that purely relies on real-time onboard computing." (Page 13)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on Model Training</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions Max-Ent IRL, more details on the training process, including data collection and model validation, would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this case study, the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (Max-Ent IRL) algorithm [89] is adopted" (Page 12)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed explanation of the model training process would enhance the technical rigor of the case study.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide information on the size and characteristics of the training dataset, the training procedure, and the metrics used for model evaluation.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss Limitations of P-ACC</strong>
        <p>The section focuses on the benefits of P-ACC but could also discuss its limitations and potential challenges for real-world deployment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Acknowledging limitations would provide a more balanced perspective and open avenues for future research.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss potential challenges like handling unexpected events, ensuring safety in diverse traffic conditions, and addressing ethical considerations related to personalized driving models.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on Generalizability</strong>
        <p>The section could discuss the generalizability of the P-ACC system to different vehicle types, driver demographics, and traffic environments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing generalizability would strengthen the case for the broader applicability of the MDT framework and the P-ACC system.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss how the system can be adapted to different contexts and what further research is needed to ensure its robustness and effectiveness in diverse scenarios.</p>
