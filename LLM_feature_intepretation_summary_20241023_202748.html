            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction provides context on the growing importance of interpretability in large language models (LLMs). It highlights the shift from analyzing individual, often polysemantic, neurons to focusing on linear combinations of neurons as representations of human-interpretable concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are introduced as a key method for extracting these more interpretable features, addressing the limitations of previous neuron-centric approaches.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Need for Interpretability:</strong> The introduction emphasizes the importance of understanding the internal representations of LLMs, despite their impressive performance.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Neuron-Level Analysis:</strong> The text points out the challenges of interpreting individual neurons due to their polysemantic nature, activating across diverse contexts.</li><li><strong>Linear Representation Hypothesis:</strong> The introduction highlights the idea that human-interpretable concepts are encoded in linear combinations of neurons, motivating the use of feature extraction methods.</li><li><strong>SAEs for Feature Extraction:</strong> Sparse autoencoders are presented as a solution to the polysemanticity problem, offering a way to extract more interpretable and potentially monosemantic latent features.</li><li><strong>Growing Use of SAEs:</strong> The text notes the increasing adoption of SAEs as an important interpretability tool for large language models, including their application to models like GPT-4 and Claude.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Context and Motivation</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context of LLM interpretability research and motivates the shift towards feature-based analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"At the same time, we understand little about the internal representations driving their behavior." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concise Explanation of SAEs</strong>
        <p></p>
        <div class="quote">"SAEs consist of two parts: an encoder that transforms activation vectors into a sparse, higher-dimensional latent space, and a decoder that projects the latents back into the original space." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Connect to Abstract&#39;s Contributions</strong>
        <p>While the introduction provides good background, explicitly linking it back to the specific contributions mentioned in the abstract would strengthen the narrative.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were proposed as a way to address polysemanticity (Cunningham et al., 2023)." (Page 1)</div>

        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly mention the automated pipeline and scoring techniques introduced in the abstract, highlighting how they address the challenges outlined in the introduction.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Expand on the Significance of Scaling SAEs</strong>
        <p>The introduction mentions scaling SAEs to larger models, but elaborating on the significance of this would enhance the impact.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Recently, a significant effort was made to scale SAE training to larger models, like GPT-4 (Gao et al., 2024) and Claude (Templeton et al., 2024), and they have become an important interpretability tool for LLMs." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This would underscore the relevance of the work to current trends in LLM interpretability.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Briefly discuss the challenges and benefits of applying SAEs to larger models, potentially mentioning computational costs or insights gained from analyzing these larger models.</p>

            <h3>Related Work</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section discusses existing work on automated interpretability, focusing on methods for explaining neuron or latent activations in large language models. It covers approaches using LLMs like GPT-4 to generate and evaluate explanations, techniques involving activation collection and pattern analysis, and alternative methods like patching latent activations into the residual stream for explanation generation.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Early LLM-based Interpretability:</strong> Early work used LLMs like GPT-4 to explain neuron activations by providing examples of activating contexts and tasking the LLM to generate explanations. These explanations were then evaluated based on their ability to predict neuron activations in new contexts.</li><li><strong>Context and Activation Pattern Analysis:</strong> Several approaches focus on collecting contexts and corresponding latent activations, then using larger models to identify patterns and generate explanations based on these patterns.</li><li><strong>Evaluation Methods:</strong> Various evaluation methods have been proposed, including having the model generate activating examples and measuring neuron activation, and using &quot;interpretability agents&quot; for iterative experimentation.</li><li><strong>Cheaper Automated Interpretability:</strong> A more resource-efficient method involves using the model being explained as the explanation generation model. This involves patching latent activations into the residual stream and generating continuations related to the latent.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Activation Collection:</strong> Latent activations were collected from SAEs trained on Llama 3.1 8b using a 10M token sample of RedPajama-v2. The analysis revealed that a significant portion of latents don&#39;t activate frequently, especially with smaller context windows, and this sparsity varies with SAE size and training data.</li><li><strong>Prompting Strategy:</strong> The explainer model, Llama 70b, was prompted with 32-token activating examples with highlighted activating tokens and their activation strength. Chain-of-thought prompting was found to not significantly improve explanation quality.</li><li><strong>Maximally Activating Contexts:</strong> The method focuses on maximally activating contexts for generating and scoring explanations, acknowledging the potential bias but prioritizing conciseness and specificity over broader, potentially less meaningful explanations.</li><li><strong>Novel Scoring Methods:</strong> Four new scoring methods are introduced: detection, fuzzing, surprisal, and embedding. These methods focus on the ability of an explanation to discriminate between activating and non-activating contexts, offering more compute-efficient alternatives to simulation scoring. Intervention scoring assesses the impact of a feature on model output.</li>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify Rationale for 32-Token Context</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions using 32-token contexts, the rationale behind this choice isn&#39;t fully explained.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The activating example is selected to only have 32 tokens, irrespective of the position of the activating tokens in the prompt." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the reason for this specific context length would provide further insight into the methodology and its potential limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two explaining the choice of 32 tokens, perhaps relating it to computational constraints or the typical length of relevant contexts for the target features.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide More Detail on Failure Modes</strong>
        <p>While the section briefly mentions failure modes of sampling strategies, providing more concrete examples would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For examples of these types of failure modes, see fig. A1 and the discussion in the appendix A.2." (Page 4)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> More detailed examples of failure modes would help readers understand the challenges and trade-offs involved in different sampling strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a brief description of the failure modes illustrated in Figure A1 and Appendix A.2, highlighting the specific issues encountered with different sampling approaches.</p>

                <p>Fig. 1. SAE latents explanations in a random sentence. To visualize the latent explanations produced, we select a sentence taken from the RPJv2 dataset. We selected 4 tokens in different positions in that sentence and filter for latents that are active in different layers. Then we randomly select active latents and their corresponding explanations to display. We display the detection and fuzzing scores of each explanation, which indicate how well it explains other examples in the dataset (see section 3 for details on these scores). The features selected had high activation, but were not cherry-picked based on explanations or scores.</p>

                <p>Figure 1 showcases examples of explanations generated by the automated pipeline for Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latents. It uses a single sentence from the RedPajama-v2 dataset and highlights four tokens. For each highlighted token, the figure displays explanations for several active latents across different layers of the model. Each explanation box includes the feature number, layer, detection score, fuzzing score, and the natural language explanation itself. The caption emphasizes that the features were selected based on high activation, not on the quality of their explanations, to avoid cherry-picking.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The methodology of selecting a single sentence and four tokens within it for visualization is a simplification. While it provides a concrete example, it doesn&#39;t demonstrate the robustness of the explanations across a wider range of contexts. The random selection of active latents is a good practice to avoid bias, but the caption doesn&#39;t specify how many latents were sampled per token.</li><li>The caption mentions detection and fuzzing scores but doesn&#39;t explain them in detail, directing the reader to section 3. This is acceptable but could be improved by briefly stating what these scores represent (e.g., accuracy of identifying activating contexts). The caption also states that features were chosen based on high activation, but doesn&#39;t define &quot;high activation&quot; quantitatively.</li><li>The figure aims to demonstrate the interpretability of SAE latents. The provided explanations seem qualitatively reasonable, but a more rigorous evaluation is needed (as mentioned in the reference text). The figure doesn&#39;t provide evidence for the claim that SAE latents are *more* interpretable than neurons, which is a central claim of the paper.</li><li>The methodology of visualizing explanations using a single sentence is not a standard practice in interpretability research. While understandable for illustrative purposes, the paper should rely on more robust quantitative evaluations for its main claims.</li></ul></div>

            <li>The figure is generally clear, but the explanation boxes could be visually improved. The feature number and layer information could be presented more concisely. The color coding of the tokens in the sentence is helpful.</li><li>The visual organization is straightforward, with clear separation between the sentence, highlighted tokens, and corresponding explanations. The inclusion of detection and fuzzing scores directly within the explanation boxes is effective.</li><li>The figure is likely understandable for an audience familiar with LLMs and interpretability research, but may require additional context for a broader audience. Terms like &quot;SAE latent,&quot; &quot;detection score,&quot; and &quot;fuzzing score&quot; should be clearly defined in the paper.</li><li>While the visualization itself is not standard, the use of captions, scores, and explanations aligns with general conventions for presenting qualitative results in interpretability research.</li></ul></div>

                <p>Fig. 2. The new proposed scoring methods. In detection scoring, the scorer model is tasked with selecting the set of sentences that activate a given latent given an explanation. In this work, we show 5 examples at the same time, and each has an identical probability of being a sentence that activates the latent, independent of whether any other example also activates the latent. The activating tokens are colored in green for display, but that information is not shown to the scorer model. For fuzzing scoring, the scorer model is tasked with selecting the sentences where the highlighted tokens are the tokens that activate a target latent given an explanation of that latent. In surprisal scoring, activating and non-activating examples are run through the model and the loss over those sentences is computed. Correct explanations should decrease the loss in activating sentences compared to a generic explanation, but shouldn&#39;t significantly decrease the loss in non-activating sentences. For embedding scoring, activating and non-activating sentences are embedded as &quot;documents&quot; that should be retrieved using the explanation as a query.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the results of comparing different scoring methods for explanations of Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latents, finding fuzzing and detection scores correlate most with simulation scoring. It also highlights the value of intervention scoring in interpreting features missed by other methods. The impact of sampling techniques, explainer model size, and SAE architecture on explanation quality are explored, showing benefits from broader sampling and larger SAEs. Finally, the overlap between latents at adjacent layers is analyzed, suggesting prioritization of wider SAEs on fewer layers for limited compute budgets.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Scoring Method Comparison:</strong> Fuzzing and detection scoring methods show the highest correlation with the established simulation scoring, while surprisal and embedding correlate more with each other and detection.</li><li><strong>Intervention Scoring:</strong> Intervention scoring proves valuable by distinguishing between trained and random SAE features and by interpreting features missed by context-based methods.</li><li><strong>Sampling Techniques:</strong> Sampling examples from across the activation distribution, rather than just the top activating examples, leads to higher quality explanations that generalize better.</li><li><strong>Explainer Model Size:</strong> Larger explainer models generally produce better explanations, but the performance difference between Llama 3.1 70b and Claude Sonnet 3.5 is not substantial.</li><li><strong>SAE Architecture:</strong> SAEs with more latents and those trained on residual streams have higher scores. Earlier layers have lower scores, but scores stabilize after initial layers.</li><li><strong>Latent Overlap:</strong> Adjacent residual stream SAEs exhibit higher semantic overlap than MLP SAEs, suggesting potential resource optimization by training wider SAEs on fewer layers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive Evaluation</strong>
        <p>The section evaluates various factors affecting explanation quality, including scoring methods, sampling techniques, and model architectures, providing a holistic view of the proposed pipeline.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We evaluate explanation quality using fuzzing, detection and embedding scores, as those were both quick to compute and easy to interpret." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Emphasis on Generalization</strong>
        <p>The study highlights the importance of evaluating explanations across the entire activation distribution, not just on top activating examples, which is a crucial aspect for robust interpretability.</p>
        <div class="quote">"This effect would not be seen if the scoring were done on just the most activating examples, underscoring a problem with current auto-interpretability evaluations..." (Page 7)</div>

    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Semantic Overlap</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions measuring semantic similarity, providing specific metrics or quantitative results would strengthen the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We observe that the residual stream SAEs have higher semantic overlap for neighboring layers than the MLP SAEs." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantitative measures would provide more concrete evidence of the observed semantic overlap and allow for more rigorous comparisons.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Report specific metrics used to quantify semantic overlap, such as cosine similarity or Frobenius inner product values, and include visualizations or tables to illustrate the differences between residual stream and MLP SAEs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Further Investigate Explainer Model Differences</strong>
        <p>The section notes similar performance between Llama and Claude, but further investigation into the reasons and potential for Claude optimization could be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We don’t find the performance of Claude Sonnet 3.5 to be much higher than that of Llama 3.1 70b..." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Understanding the factors influencing explainer model performance could lead to improved explanation quality and more efficient use of resources.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Conduct further experiments to analyze the impact of prompt optimization and model architecture on explanation quality for both Llama and Claude, potentially exploring different prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches.</p>

            <h3>Overlap Between Latents at Adjacent Layers</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section explores the overlap between latent features learned by SAEs at adjacent layers in the residual stream of a transformer model. It highlights the motivation for studying this overlap, including potential resource optimization and sanity-checking the interpretability pipeline. The Hungarian algorithm is used to align latents due to permutation symmetry, and the analysis reveals greater semantic similarity between adjacent residual stream SAEs compared to MLP SAEs, suggesting potential compute savings by training wider SAEs on fewer layers.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Motivation for Overlap Analysis:</strong> Investigating feature overlap can reveal redundancies, inform training strategies, and validate the consistency of the interpretability pipeline.</li><li><strong>Permutation Symmetry and Alignment:</strong> The Hungarian algorithm is employed to address the permutation symmetry issue and align latents for meaningful comparison between layers.</li><li><strong>Semantic Similarity Measurement:</strong> The Frobenius inner product of explanation embeddings is used to measure the semantic similarity between aligned latents.</li><li><strong>Residual Stream vs. MLP Overlap:</strong> Adjacent residual stream SAEs demonstrate higher semantic overlap than MLP SAEs, suggesting different training prioritization strategies.</li><li><strong>Resource Optimization Implications:</strong> The findings suggest that training wider SAEs on a smaller subset of residual stream layers may be more compute-efficient than training narrower SAEs on all layers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear Motivation</strong>
        <p>The section clearly articulates the reasons for studying latent overlap, connecting it to practical concerns like resource optimization and pipeline validation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Measuring the degree of feature overlap is interesting for a few reasons. First, if adjacent SAEs learn almost identical features, it may not be worthwhile to train and interpret SAEs at every single residual stream layer." (Page 9)</div>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Visualize Overlap</strong>
        <p>While the text describes the use of the Frobenius inner product, visualizing the overlap between layers would enhance understanding and provide a more intuitive representation of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We observe that the residual stream SAEs have higher semantic overlap for neighboring layers than the MLP SAEs." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Visualizations can effectively communicate complex relationships and patterns, making the results more accessible and impactful.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include heatmaps or other visual representations of the Frobenius inner product matrices, illustrating the degree of overlap between different layers for both residual stream and MLP SAEs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Overlap Difference</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions higher overlap in residual stream SAEs, quantifying this difference would strengthen the claim and provide a more precise comparison.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We observe that the residual stream SAEs have higher semantic overlap for neighboring layers than the MLP SAEs." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Quantitative measures provide more concrete evidence and allow for more rigorous comparisons between different architectures.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Report specific values for the Frobenius inner product or other relevant metrics for both residual stream and MLP SAEs, potentially including statistical significance tests to assess the difference in overlap.</p>

        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more concrete details about future work would give readers a clearer understanding of the research trajectory and potential future contributions.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the planned improvements for handling long-context features and incorporating explanation length into metrics. Discuss potential approaches, such as using hierarchical models or reinforcement learning techniques, to address these challenges.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Quantify Potential Resource Savings</strong>
        <p>While the conclusion mentions resource optimization, quantifying the potential savings from training wider SAEs on fewer layers would strengthen the argument.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Our results suggest that, when compute resources are constrained, it may be more efficient to train wider SAEs on a small subset of residual stream layers, rather than narrower SAEs on all layers." (Page 10)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing concrete numbers or estimates of the potential compute savings would make the resource optimization argument more compelling and impactful.</p>
