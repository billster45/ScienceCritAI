        <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet, a diet designed for both human and planetary health, and cardiometabolic risk factors in a sample of 398 adults and elderly residents of Natal, Brazil, between 2019 and 2020. Researchers used the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) to measure how closely participants&#39; diets aligned with the EAT-Lancet recommendations and the Cardiovascular Health Diet Index (CHDI) to assess cardiovascular health. The study collected sociodemographic information, lifestyle data, dietary intake via 24-hour recall, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical markers. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the associations between the PHDI, CHDI, and cardiometabolic risk factors, while adjusting for potential confounders like age, body mass index (BMI), and income. The study aimed to understand how dietary patterns impact both individual and environmental well-being.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The average PHDI score was 29.4 out of 150, indicating moderate adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. This was measured using a 24-hour dietary recall, where participants listed all the foods and drinks they consumed in the past day. This information was then used to calculate the PHDI score. The moderate adherence suggests that the study population&#39;s diets were not fully aligned with the EAT-Lancet recommendations, highlighting potential areas for improvement in dietary habits for both individual and planetary health.</li><li>The average CHDI score was 32.63 out of 110, also suggesting moderate cardiovascular health. This was calculated based on participants&#39; consumption of various food groups like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The moderate CHDI score indicates that there&#39;s room for improvement in the study population&#39;s cardiovascular health through dietary modifications.</li><li>A positive association was observed between PHDI and CHDI scores. This means that participants with higher PHDI scores (better adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet) tended to also have higher CHDI scores (better cardiovascular health). This was determined using regression analysis, which helps identify relationships between variables. This finding suggests that adopting a more sustainable diet may also benefit cardiovascular health.</li><li>Higher PHDI scores were associated with lower systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. These associations were statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. These findings highlight the potential cardiovascular benefits of adhering to a sustainable diet like the EAT-Lancet diet.</li><li>Participants with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia (an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood) had lower PHDI scores. This suggests that these conditions may be linked to less sustainable dietary patterns. Addressing dietary habits could be a potential strategy for managing these conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The study&#39;s comprehensive data collection, encompassing sociodemographic factors, lifestyle information, dietary habits, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical markers, allows for a thorough analysis of the research question. This breadth of data strengthens the study&#39;s ability to identify and understand the complex interplay between diet, health, and lifestyle factors.</li><li>The use of validated dietary indices, namely the PHDI and CHDI, provides standardized and reliable measures of dietary quality and cardiovascular health. These indices allow for objective comparisons and facilitate interpretation of the findings in relation to established dietary guidelines.</li><li>The study&#39;s consideration of potential confounders like age, BMI, and income in the regression models improves the validity of the findings. By accounting for these factors, the study reduces the risk of spurious associations and provides a more accurate representation of the relationship between diet and cardiometabolic health.</li><li>The study provides valuable insights into dietary patterns and their association with health outcomes in a developing country context. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence on the importance of sustainable diets for both human and planetary health, particularly in regions facing challenges related to food security and nutrition.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to establish causal relationships between dietary habits and health outcomes. Future research using longitudinal designs, which track participants&#39; dietary habits and health outcomes over time, would allow for stronger causal inferences.</li><li>While the study presents average PHDI and CHDI scores, it lacks context for interpreting these scores. Providing more information on what constitutes a high, moderate, and low score on each index would help readers better understand the magnitude of adherence to these diets in the study population.</li><li>The study does not address the handling of missing data. Clarifying the extent of missing data and the methods used to address missingness would enhance the transparency and reliability of the results.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figure 2 provides a clear and concise overview of the study population&#39;s dietary patterns. It allows for a visual comparison of adherence to both the sustainability-focused PHDI and the heart-health-focused CHDI, highlighting areas of alignment and divergence.</p>
    </div>
    
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study provides evidence for a positive association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and improved cardiovascular health indicators in a Brazilian population. The findings suggest that promoting sustainable diets may offer co-benefits for both planetary and human health. Further research, particularly using longitudinal designs and incorporating detailed policy recommendations, is needed to establish causality and translate these findings into effective public health interventions. Future research should also address the challenges of promoting sustainable diets in diverse sociocultural contexts, particularly in developing countries facing issues related to food access and affordability. Exploring culturally tailored interventions to promote healthy and sustainable eating habits could improve population health and contribute to global sustainability efforts.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This introduction sets the stage for a study investigating the relationship between the EAT-Lancet diet and cardiovascular health. It begins by highlighting the global prevalence and preventability of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), emphasizing the role of diet and lifestyle. The introduction then discusses the interconnectedness of human health and environmental sustainability, particularly in the context of dietary choices. It introduces the concept of sustainable diets and their potential benefits for cardiovascular health, primarily through mechanisms like replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats and increasing fiber intake. The introduction also acknowledges the challenges of adopting sustainable diets, such as accessibility and cost, especially in contexts of inequality. Finally, it introduces the EAT-Lancet Commission&#39;s report and its proposed &quot;planetary health diet&quot; (PHD), which aims to promote both human and planetary well-being. The introduction concludes by emphasizing the need to study dietary patterns to understand the synergy between cardiovascular health and planetary health and introduces the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) and Cardiovascular Health Diet Index (CHDI) as tools for this purpose.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally, but many are preventable through lifestyle changes, including diet.</li><li>Dietary choices are crucial for both human health and environmental sustainability.</li><li>Sustainable diets, rich in plant-based foods and low in processed foods, meats, and added sugars, offer potential benefits for cardiovascular health.</li><li>Accessibility and cost are key challenges in adopting sustainable diets, particularly in contexts of inequality.</li><li>The EAT-Lancet Commission&#39;s &quot;planetary health diet&quot; (PHD) provides a framework for promoting both human and planetary health.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Establishes context and relevance.</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context of the study by highlighting the global burden of CVDs and their preventability. This emphasizes the relevance of the research question.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) account for 70% of deaths, 45% of which are caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVD), equivalent to more than 17 million deaths worldwide [1, 2]. Approximately 75% of CVDs are preventable, requiring adequate management of cardiometabolic risk factors (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) and behavioral factors associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy diet, characterized by high intake of fats, sodium, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connects diet to both health and sustainability.</strong>
        <p>The introduction clearly links dietary choices to both human health and environmental sustainability, setting the stage for investigating the synergy between these two aspects.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In addition to health implications, examining how these diets contribute to environmental degradation is important, given that dietary choices are essential determinants of both human health and environmental sustainability [3, 4]." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Introduces key concepts and frameworks.</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively introduces key concepts like sustainable diets, the EAT-Lancet Commission&#39;s report, and the PHD, providing a foundation for understanding the study&#39;s focus.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In early 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission released a scientific report titled “Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems,” outlining sustainable dietary practices. Within this report, they introduced the “planetary health diet” (PHD), a suggested dietary framework aimed at promoting both human and planetary well-being." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Streamline the discussion of diet-environment interactions.</strong>
        <p>The introduction could streamline the discussion of the complex relationship between nutritionally adequate diets and environmental impact. While the point about potential conflicts is valid, it could be made more concisely.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It is important to state that, even with a significant overlap between health-promoting and environmentally sustainable diets, the main discourse of planetary health theory, aligning a healthy diet with a sustainable planet; however, is not always achievable. A nutritionally adequate diet may have a high environmental impact, whereas a diet with lower ecological impacts may be nutrient-poor [6]." (Page 2)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more concise explanation would improve the flow and readability of the introduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Condense the information into a single, clear sentence highlighting the potential for conflict between nutritional adequacy and environmental impact.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the rationale for studying dietary patterns.</strong>
        <p>The introduction could more explicitly explain why studying dietary patterns is crucial for understanding the relationship between diet, health, and sustainability. It mentions that dietary patterns provide a more comprehensive analysis, but it could elaborate on this point.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Synergism between risk (or protective) factors for cardiovascular health and planetary health can only be identified in the study of dietary patterns, as they provide a more comprehensive analysis that is consistent with current recommendations in the scientific literature." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A stronger rationale would better justify the study&#39;s focus on dietary patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand on the advantages of studying dietary patterns, such as their ability to capture the combined effects of multiple food groups and dietary components.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the distinction between a priori and a posteriori approaches.</strong>
        <p>The introduction briefly mentions a priori and a posteriori approaches to dietary pattern analysis but doesn&#39;t clearly explain the difference. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with these terms.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Dietary patterns are classified into two approaches: the first, called a priori, is based on prior knowledge of the favorable and unfavorable effects of dietary constituents (e.g. using the Diet Quality Index). The other approach, a posteriori, is based on the dietary data obtained." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A clear distinction between these approaches would enhance the reader&#39;s understanding of the methodological landscape.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide a more detailed explanation of each approach, including examples and their respective strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    </li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed description of sampling procedure.</strong>
        <p>The section provides a thorough explanation of the sampling plan, including the rationale for the chosen method, the stages involved, and the adjustments made due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This level of detail enhances the study&#39;s transparency and reproducibility.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The sampling plan considered a probability sampling by conglomerates in two stages (census tracts and households). The census tracts were randomly selected with probability proportional to their size (number of households). The selection aimed to obtain a minimum of 258 interviews for each of the four strata of sex and age: adults (20 to 59) and elderly individuals (60 years or older) of both sexes." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive data collection.</strong>
        <p>The study collected a wide range of data, including sociodemographic factors, lifestyle information, dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical markers. This comprehensive approach allows for a more thorough investigation of the research question.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Socioeconomic and lifestyle data, anthropometric measurements, and dietary consumption were collected. We used the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) and the Cardiovascular Health Diet Index (CHDI) for cardiovascular health to assess adherence to the diet’s sustainability. The evaluated cardiometabolic parameters included fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements." (Page 3)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clear explanation of dietary assessment.</strong>
        <p>The section clearly explains how dietary intake was assessed, including the use of a 24-hour dietary recall and the calculation of the PHDI and CHDI. This clarity is crucial for understanding how the key exposures were measured.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The evaluation of dietary intake involved the use of a 24-hour dietary recall (R24h), which was used to calculate the PHDI and CHDI [24]. The R24h detailed all foods consumed by the participant on the previous day and was conducted using a structured script provided by the Globodiet® software (39], which guides a five stages interview." (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Justify the sample size.</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions the target sample size and the impact of the pandemic, it doesn&#39;t explicitly justify the final sample size of 398 or discuss its adequacy for the study&#39;s objectives. A power analysis or a justification based on the expected effect size and desired precision would strengthen this aspect.</p>
        <div class="quote">"For the current study, 398 individuals with information on dietary consumption were included, of whom 111 had results of biochemical parameters, with a sample power of 80% calculated using the OpenEpi program, considering a finite population, a frequency of 25% for cardiovascular risk factors, an estimation error of 10%, and a design effect of 2.5%." (Page 3)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Justifying the sample size would enhance the study&#39;s rigor and provide readers with greater confidence in the results.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a power analysis or a clear justification for the final sample size, explaining how it was determined and why it is considered sufficient for the study&#39;s aims.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more detail on the regression models.</strong>
        <p>The section mentions the use of multiple linear regression models but doesn&#39;t specify the exact variables included in each model or the specific hypotheses being tested. Providing more detail on the model specifications would improve the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We developed multiple linear regression models to pinpoint factors that could serve as predictors (CHDI, clinical, and biochemical parameters) of adherence to PHDI in its continuous form (dependent variable) and to estimate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the diet." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed description of the regression models would allow readers to better understand the statistical analysis and interpret the results.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Specify the dependent and independent variables included in each model, along with any interaction terms or transformations applied. Also, state the specific hypotheses being tested by each model.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Clarify the handling of missing data.</strong>
        <p>The section doesn&#39;t mention how missing data were handled in the analysis. It&#39;s important to address this issue, as missing data can introduce bias and affect the validity of the results.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing the issue of missing data would enhance the study&#39;s transparency and allow readers to assess the potential impact of missingness on the findings.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Describe the extent of missing data for each variable and explain the methods used to handle missingness, such as imputation or complete case analysis.</p>

        <p>Figure 1 is an infographic detailing the eleven components of the CHDI (Cardiovascular Health Diet Index) and how they are scored. Each component represents a food group, and the scoring is based on daily consumption amounts. Higher scores indicate better adherence to a cardioprotective diet. For example, consuming more than 340g of fruits per day earns the maximum 10 points for that component, while no fruit consumption earns 0 points. Similarly, the scoring for vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and dairy is based on exceeding specific daily intake thresholds. Conversely, the scoring for red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), processed meat, and ultra-processed foods (UPF) is inversely related to consumption; lower intake earns higher scores.

            <h3>Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This section presents the findings of the study, which examined the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and cardiometabolic risk factors. The average Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) score was 29.4 out of 150, and the average Cardiovascular Health Diet Index (CHDI) score was 32.63 out of 110. The PHDI score was positively associated with the CHDI score and the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Conversely, it was negatively associated with ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption. The most frequently consumed UPFs were packaged snacks, potatoes, and crackers, followed by margarine. A higher PHDI score was also linked to lower systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Additionally, individuals with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia had lower PHDI scores.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Average PHDI and CHDI scores:</strong> The mean PHDI was 29.4 (out of 150), and the mean CHDI was 32.63 (out of 110). This indicates moderate adherence to both diets in the study population.</li><li><strong>Association between PHDI and CHDI:</strong> A positive association was found between the PHDI and CHDI scores, suggesting that adherence to a sustainable diet is linked to better cardiovascular health.</li><li><strong>Relationship with food groups:</strong> The PHDI score was positively associated with fruit, vegetable, and legume intake, and negatively associated with UPF consumption. This highlights the importance of these food groups in a sustainable and heart-healthy diet.</li><li><strong>Association with cardiometabolic markers:</strong> Higher PHDI scores were associated with lower systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, indicating potential cardiovascular benefits of the EAT-Lancet diet.</li><li><strong>PHDI and chronic conditions:</strong> Individuals with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia had lower PHDI scores, suggesting a link between unsustainable diets and these conditions.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear presentation of key findings.</strong>
        <p>The results section clearly presents the main findings of the study, including the average PHDI and CHDI scores and their associations with various factors. The use of tables and figures enhances the clarity of the presentation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The mean PHDI was 29.4 (95% CI 28.04:30.81), on a total score ranging from 0 to 150 points and the mean CHDI was 32.63 (95% CI 31.50:33.78), on a total score ranging from 0 to 110 points. PHDI showed a significant positive association with the final CHDI score and components of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, and a negative association with Ultra-processed Food (UPF) (p &lt; 0.05)." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Use of appropriate statistical methods.</strong>
        <p>The study uses appropriate statistical methods, such as multiple linear regression, to analyze the data and control for potential confounders. This strengthens the validity of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"We developed multiple linear regression models to pinpoint factors that could serve as predictors (CHDI, clinical, and biochemical parameters) of adherence to PHDI in its continuous form (dependent variable) and to estimate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the diet." (Page 7)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Specific examples of UPF consumption.</strong>
        <p>The results section provides specific examples of the most commonly consumed UPFs in the study population, which helps to contextualize the findings and make them more relatable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Notably, among the most consumed UPF, the following stand out: “packaged snacks, shoestring potatoes, and crackers” (16.94%), followed by margarine (14.14%)." (Page 2)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Provide more context for the PHDI and CHDI scores.</strong>
        <p>While the average PHDI and CHDI scores are presented, the section could provide more context for interpreting these scores. For example, explaining what constitutes a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; score on each index would be helpful.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The mean PHDI was 29.4 (95% CI 28.04:30.81), on a total score ranging from 0 to 150 points and the mean CHDI was 32.63 (95% CI 31.50:33.78), on a total score ranging from 0 to 110 points." (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Providing more context for the scores would help readers understand the magnitude of adherence to each diet in the study population.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Explain what constitutes a high, moderate, and low score on both the PHDI and CHDI. Consider providing reference values from other studies or populations if available.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss the clinical significance of the findings.</strong>
        <p>The results section focuses on statistical significance but could be strengthened by discussing the clinical significance of the findings. For example, explaining the practical implications of the observed associations between PHDI and cardiometabolic markers would be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"From the results obtained in Table 4, it can be inferred that when using the linear regression model adjusted for age, income, and BMI, individuals had a negative association with SBP (mmHg) (β -0.14, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.01), total cholesterol (mg/dL) (β -0.80, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.46), and LDL-c (mg/dL) (β -0.10, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.08) with p &lt; 0.05." (Page 9)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Discussing the clinical significance would make the findings more relevant to healthcare professionals and readers interested in the practical implications of the study.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Interpret the magnitude of the observed associations in terms of their potential impact on cardiovascular health outcomes. Consider discussing the clinical relevance of the changes in SBP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Present the results of the regression models more comprehensively.</strong>
        <p>While the section mentions some key associations, it doesn&#39;t present the full results of the regression models. Including a table with all the regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values would provide a more complete picture of the analysis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Presenting the full results of the regression models would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a table that summarizes the results of all the regression models, including the coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values for all the independent variables.</p>

        <p>Table 3 presents the contribution of ultra-processed foods (UPF) to the total caloric intake of participants in the Brazuca-Natal Study. The table is organized by the NOVA score, a system for classifying foods based on their level of processing. Each row represents a different NOVA score, ranging from 0 to 7, indicating the number of UPF &#39;points&#39; present in a participant&#39;s diet. The table shows the number (N) and percentage of participants with each score and the corresponding percentage of their total caloric intake derived from UPF, presented with a 95% confidence interval. For example, participants with a NOVA score of 0 (no UPF points) derived approximately 9.78% of their calories from UPF, while those with a score of 7 derived close to 39.01% of their calories from UPF. The table demonstrates a clear trend: as the NOVA score increases (more UPF points), the percentage of calories from UPF also increases.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This discussion section analyzes the study results within the context of planetary health, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of human actions, ecosystems, and human well-being. The study found a significant association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet (measured by the PHDI) and improved cardiovascular health indicators (lower SBP, total cholesterol, and LDL-c). Individuals with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia had lower PHDI scores. The discussion explores the potential mechanisms behind this synergy, including increased fiber intake, weight management, and improved gut microbiota. It also examines the role of specific food groups, highlighting the positive contributions of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, and the negative impact of ultra-processed foods (UPF). The discussion acknowledges the challenges of adopting sustainable diets, particularly in developing countries like Brazil, where socioeconomic inequalities and cultural influences play a significant role. It concludes by emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to promote both healthy and sustainable dietary habits, including policy interventions.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul><li><strong>Planetary health and diet:</strong> The discussion emphasizes the link between human actions, ecosystems, and well-being, positioning the study within the broader context of planetary health.</li><li><strong>Synergy between sustainable diets and cardiovascular health:</strong> The study found a positive association between the EAT-Lancet diet (PHDI) and improved cardiovascular health markers, suggesting a synergistic relationship.</li><li><strong>Mechanisms of action:</strong> The discussion explores potential mechanisms explaining the health benefits of sustainable diets, including increased fiber intake, weight management, and positive effects on gut microbiota.</li><li><strong>Role of specific food groups:</strong> The discussion highlights the importance of fruits, vegetables, and legumes in a sustainable and heart-healthy diet, while emphasizing the negative impact of UPF.</li><li><strong>Challenges and considerations:</strong> The discussion acknowledges the challenges of adopting sustainable diets, particularly in developing countries, and considers the role of socioeconomic factors and cultural influences.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Contextualizes the findings within planetary health.</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively places the study&#39;s findings within the broader framework of planetary health, highlighting the interconnectedness of human health and environmental sustainability. This adds depth and relevance to the research.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Planetary health is a global concern focused on the dynamic and systemic relationships between human action in ecosystems and how it affects human health and well-being [52]." (Page 9)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Explores potential mechanisms of action.</strong>
        <p>The discussion goes beyond simply reporting the associations and delves into the potential mechanisms by which sustainable diets can improve cardiovascular health. This strengthens the interpretation of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The mechanisms driving the synergy between having a sustainable diet and cardiovascular health can largely be attributed to three processes: Firstly, a sustainable diet is rich in fiber, mainly derived from fruits, vegetables, and legumes, which play a prominent role in the dietary treatment of CVDs and T2DM [59, 64]." (Page 10)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Addresses challenges and limitations.</strong>
        <p>The discussion acknowledges the challenges of adopting sustainable diets, particularly in developing countries, and discusses the limitations of the study&#39;s cross-sectional design. This enhances the discussion&#39;s transparency and scientific rigor.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Underdeveloped countries like Brazil, Gambia, India, and Mexico have been gaining prominence internationally concerning the analysis of sustainable diets [24, 55, 85, 86]. However, there are some barriers to these dietary changes, such as measuring adherence in countries with continental dimensions and heterogeneous territories, as in the case of Brazil, which is marked by socioeconomic inequalities in food consumption across its various regions [26, 87, 88]." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Strengthen the discussion of UPF.</strong>
        <p>While the discussion mentions the negative impact of UPF, it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how UPF consumption contributes to poor cardiovascular health and environmental problems. Connecting UPF consumption to specific mechanisms, such as inflammation or gut dysbiosis, would be beneficial.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Among the foods that stand out negatively in the synergy between a good diet for health and for the planet is UPF, characterized by their degree of processing, high in ‘empty’ calories (fats and sugars), which become attractive to consumers for their convenience, low cost, and high palatability [46]." (Page 11)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A more detailed discussion of UPF would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its negative impacts and strengthen the argument for promoting sustainable diets.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Provide specific examples of how UPF contributes to poor health and environmental problems. Discuss the mechanisms by which UPF exerts these negative effects, such as its impact on inflammation, gut microbiota, or resource use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on policy implications.</strong>
        <p>The discussion briefly mentions the importance of policy interventions but could be expanded to provide more specific recommendations for promoting sustainable diets. Discussing specific policy options, such as food labeling regulations, taxes on unhealthy foods, or subsidies for healthy foods, would be valuable.</p>
        <div class="quote">"In this regard, the State’s intervention in food policies is highlighted as an essential factor in solidifying the practice of sustainable eating." (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Elaborating on policy implications would make the discussion more impactful and provide actionable recommendations for promoting sustainable diets.</p>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Discuss specific policy options that could be implemented to encourage sustainable dietary choices. Consider examples from other countries or regions that have successfully implemented such policies.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Connect the discussion back to the study&#39;s limitations.</strong>
        <p>While the discussion acknowledges the study&#39;s limitations, it could be strengthened by explicitly connecting these limitations to the interpretation of the findings.

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The study concludes that adopting a sustainable diet, like the EAT-Lancet diet, is associated with better cardiovascular health indicators. This reinforces the idea that diets that are good for the planet are also good for people. The study also found a link between higher ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption and lower adherence to sustainable diets. The authors suggest that access to diverse food production, processing, and marketing is essential for achieving both human and planetary health. They emphasize the importance of integrating healthy and sustainable dietary guidelines and highlight the role of government food policies in promoting sustainable eating.</p>
