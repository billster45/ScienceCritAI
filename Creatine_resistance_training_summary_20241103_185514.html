            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Objective and Hypothesis:</strong> This meta-analysis investigated the impact of creatine supplementation combined with resistance training on muscle strength in adults under 50.  It aimed to address limitations of previous meta-analyses by focusing on a specific age group and using weighted mean differences (WMD) in kilograms to quantify strength gains.  This approach allows for a more practical interpretation of the results compared to using standardized mean differences (SMD).  The study hypothesized that creatine supplementation with resistance training would lead to greater muscle strength gains compared to resistance training with a placebo.</li><li><strong>Methodology:</strong> The researchers searched four databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, with a search end date of May 22, 2024.  Twenty-three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria.  These criteria included studies comparing creatine supplementation combined with resistance training to a placebo combined with resistance training in healthy adults under 50.  The primary outcome was the change in maximal muscle strength, measured pre- and post-intervention, primarily using one-repetition maximum (1RM) tests.  This focus on 1RM provides a direct measure of maximal strength capacity.</li><li><strong>Main Findings:</strong> Creatine supplementation combined with resistance training significantly increased both upper and lower body strength compared to placebo.  The weighted mean difference (WMD) for upper body strength was 4.43 kg, and for lower body strength was 11.35 kg, both with p &lt; 0.001.  Subgroup analyses revealed a trend for greater upper body strength improvements in males compared to females using creatine (p=0.067).  Males on creatine significantly increased both upper and lower body strength, while females showed no significant gains.  A trend towards greater lower body strength gains was observed with higher doses of creatine (p=0.068).  No other variables significantly influenced the effect of creatine.</li><li><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The study concludes that creatine supplementation combined with resistance training enhances both upper and lower body muscle strength in adults under 50, with greater benefits observed in males.  These findings suggest that creatine is a beneficial ergogenic aid for increasing muscle strength when used in conjunction with resistance training.  The study highlights the need for further research to explore sex-specific responses to creatine and to optimize resistance training protocols for maximizing strength gains with creatine supplementation.</li>

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear statement of objective</strong>
        <p>The abstract clearly states the main objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis, which is to investigate the effects of creatine supplementation and resistance training on muscle strength gains in adults under 50 years of age, considering the influence of variables such as age, training duration, and sex.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Therefore, the purpose of this study was to consider the effect of these variables on the potential efficacy of creatine supplementation and resistance training for improving measures of muscle strength." (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Concise summary of methodology</strong>
        <p>The abstract effectively summarizes the methodology employed in the review, including the databases searched, the search end date, and the number of studies included, specifying the number of male and female participants.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Four databases were searched (MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and SPORTDiscus) with a search end date of 22 May 2024. Twenty-three studies were included, with 20 studies involving males (447 male participants), 2 studies involving females (40 female participants), and 1 study involving both males and females (13 male participants and 9 female participants)."

            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Specify the type of creatine used</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion that would enhance the clarity and informativeness of the abstract.  The abstract should explicitly state the specific types of creatine used in the included studies, as this information is crucial for interpreting the results and for the reproducibility of the study.  Different forms of creatine may have varying effects on muscle strength, and specifying the type used allows for a more accurate assessment of the intervention&#x27;s efficacy. This would also aid future research in selecting the appropriate creatine form for their studies.  Clearly stating the creatine form used in the abstract improves the transparency and scientific rigor of the review.</p>
        <div class="quote">"creatine supplementation" (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence to the Methods section of the abstract specifying the type of creatine used in the included studies. For example, &quot;All included studies used creatine monohydrate supplementation.&quot; If different forms of creatine were used, specify the different forms and the number of studies using each form.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Creatine as an Ergogenic Aid:</strong> The introduction begins by establishing creatine as a popular ergogenic aid, especially in strength-based activities. It cites references supporting this claim.  The introduction then highlights the established benefit of creatine supplementation, particularly when combined with resistance training, in enhancing muscle strength across various populations.  This sets the stage for a more focused discussion of the specific research question.</li><li><strong>Limitations of Existing Literature:</strong> The introduction discusses the existing literature on creatine and its effects on muscle strength. It points out that while several reviews and meta-analyses have examined this topic, they often include diverse exercise types and age ranges, limiting their generalizability.  The introduction then focuses on the limitations of previous meta-analyses, particularly those that have investigated the combined effects of creatine and resistance training in older populations.  This highlights the need for research focusing on younger adults.</li><li><strong>Critique of SMD and Justification for WMD:</strong> The introduction highlights another limitation of existing research: the use of standardized mean differences (SMD) for data pooling.  It explains that SMD, while useful, can be challenging to interpret practically as it expresses effect size in units of standard deviation rather than more applicable units like kilograms.  This justifies the current study&#x27;s use of weighted mean differences (WMD) in kilograms, which provides a more practical and readily interpretable measure of strength gains.</li><li><strong>Study Objective and Hypothesis:</strong> The introduction states the specific objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis: to examine the effects of creatine supplementation combined with resistance training on muscle strength in healthy adults under 50.  It emphasizes the use of WMD in kilograms to quantify strength gains.  The introduction also states the study&#x27;s hypothesis: that creatine supplementation combined with resistance training will lead to greater muscle strength gains compared to resistance training with a placebo.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Contextual Background</strong>
        <p>The introduction effectively establishes the context of creatine supplementation as a widely used ergogenic aid, particularly in strength-based sports and activities.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Creatine supplementation is one of the most commonly used ergogenic aids by individuals involved in high-intensity and/or strength-based sports and activities (e.g., resistance training)" (Page 1)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>State Knowledge Gap</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion as it would enhance the introduction by providing a more focused and specific rationale for the study. While the introduction mentions the limitations of previous meta-analyses, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the gap in knowledge that this study aims to fill.  Clearly defining this gap would strengthen the rationale and highlight the study&#x27;s unique contribution.  This would also improve the reader&#x27;s understanding of the study&#x27;s purpose and its importance within the existing literature.  Adding a clear statement about the knowledge gap would significantly improve the introduction by providing a more compelling justification for the study.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Creatine supplementation is one of the most commonly used ergogenic aids" (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a sentence or two after the discussion of previous meta-analyses, clearly stating the specific gap in knowledge this study addresses. For example, &quot;However, there is a lack of research specifically investigating the effects of creatine supplementation on strength gains in adults under 50 years of age, considering the influence of sex and training variables. This study aims to address this gap by...&quot;</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Outline Hypothesized Mechanisms</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion that would improve the clarity and organization of the introduction.  While the introduction mentions the general benefits of creatine, it would be beneficial to provide a more concise and structured overview of the hypothesized mechanisms by which creatine improves muscle strength.  This would help readers understand the physiological basis of the study and connect it to the subsequent sections.  Providing a structured overview of the hypothesized mechanisms would enhance the introduction by offering a clear roadmap for the reader and setting the stage for the subsequent sections on methods and results.  This would improve the overall flow and coherence of the paper.</p>
        <div class="quote">"It is well established that creatine supplementation, primarily when combined with resistance training, increases measures of muscle performance, specifically muscle strength, across a variety of populations [3]." (Page 1)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add a paragraph after the general introduction of creatine, outlining the hypothesized mechanisms by which creatine improves muscle strength. Use bullet points or numbered lists to clearly present each mechanism. For example, &quot;Creatine is hypothesized to improve muscle strength through several mechanisms: 1) Increased ATP resynthesis, 2) Enhanced glycogen storage, 3) Reduced muscle damage.&quot;</p>

            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines and registered the protocol on PROSPERO.  They searched four databases from inception until May 22, 2024, using keywords related to creatine and resistance training.  This systematic approach ensures a comprehensive and unbiased search for relevant studies.</li><li><strong>Eligibility Criteria:</strong> Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving healthy individuals under 50, comparing creatine supplementation with resistance training to placebo with resistance training.  The primary outcome was muscle strength gains measured before and after the intervention.  These criteria ensure the inclusion of high-quality studies directly addressing the research question.</li><li><strong>Study Selection Process:</strong> Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, resolving discrepancies through discussion.  Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa = 0.83).  This process minimizes bias and ensures consistency in study selection.</li><li><strong>Quality Assessment:</strong> Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale by two independent reviewers, with a high inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.91).  The average PEDro score was 7.00 ± 0.95, indicating good quality.  This assessment provides an indication of the methodological rigor of the included studies.</li><li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Data extracted included study characteristics, participant demographics, creatine supplementation details (dose, duration), resistance training characteristics (frequency, duration), and pre- and post-intervention muscle strength measurements (primarily 1RM).  Authors were contacted for missing data.  This comprehensive data extraction allows for a thorough analysis of the effects of creatine.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Weighted mean differences (WMD) in kilograms were used to quantify the effect of creatine on muscle strength.  Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.  Subgroup analyses were conducted based on creatine characteristics, training characteristics, and participant characteristics.  Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger&#x27;s regression test.  These analyses provide a robust and nuanced understanding of the effects of creatine.</li>

        <li><strong>Purpose of the Table</strong>: This table details the criteria used to select studies for inclusion in a systematic review examining the effects of creatine supplementation combined with resistance training on muscle strength.  The table uses the PICOS framework, which stands for Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study design, to organize these criteria. For each of these five categories, the table lists what characteristics a study must have to be included, as well as what characteristics would disqualify a study.</li><li><strong>Explanation of PICOS</strong>: The PICOS framework is a widely used tool in evidence-based medicine to define the scope of a systematic review. The Population section defines the specific characteristics of the participants included in the eligible studies. The Intervention section specifies the treatment or intervention being studied. The Comparison section defines the control group or alternative treatment against which the intervention is compared. The Outcome section defines the specific effects or results that the review seeks to analyze. Lastly, the Study design states which study design should be included in the review.</li><li><strong>Explanation of RCTs</strong>: RCTs are experiments where participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups (e.g., creatine vs. placebo), allowing researchers to determine the effects of the treatment.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Excluded Study Types</strong>: This table explains that this particular review excluded any studies that weren&#x27;t available in full text, weren&#x27;t randomized controlled trials, involved only a single administration of treatment, or were not peer-reviewed. They also excluded systematic reviews, meta-analyses, opinion pieces, reviews, case reports and editorials.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion of Non-Peer-Reviewed Material</strong>: Excluding non-peer-reviewed publications, opinion pieces, reviews, case reports, and editorials is crucial for maintaining scientific rigor, as these sources do not typically undergo the same level of scrutiny as peer-reviewed research.</li><li><strong>Focus on RCTs</strong>: Focusing on RCTs is a standard practice in systematic reviews examining treatment efficacy.  RCTs, due to their randomized design, are considered the gold standard for establishing causal relationships between interventions and outcomes, minimizing bias and increasing the reliability of findings.</li><li><strong>Exclusion of Acute Interventions</strong>: Excluding acute interventions is justified as the research question focuses on the effects of combined creatine supplementation and resistance *training*.  Acute interventions, which examine immediate effects, would not provide insight into the adaptive responses to a training program, which is the focus of the review.</li></ul>

The criteria themselves are presented logically, categorized by PICOS components (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study Design).</li><li><strong>Use of PICOS Framework</strong>: Using the PICOS framework is a standard and accepted practice in systematic reviews, facilitating a comprehensive and structured approach to defining eligibility criteria.  This strengthens the communication by adhering to established norms in the field, making the review process more understandable and credible for other researchers.</li></ul>

            <h3>3. Results</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Study Selection:</strong> From an initial pool of 1586 records, 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria after removing duplicates and screening titles, abstracts, and full texts.  These 23 studies formed the basis of the meta-analysis.  This rigorous selection process ensures that the included studies are relevant to the research question and of sufficient quality.</li><li><strong>Methodological Quality:</strong> The included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the PEDro scale.  The average PEDro score was 7.00, indicating &quot;good&quot; methodological quality.  Two studies were rated as &quot;excellent,&quot; and the remaining 21 were rated as &quot;good.&quot;  This assessment provides an indication of the internal validity and reliability of the included studies.</li><li><strong>Participant Characteristics:</strong> The 23 included studies involved a total of 487 participants.  Most studies involved male participants (n=447), with only two studies exclusively involving females (n=40) and one study including both males and females (n=22).  The participant characteristics are important for understanding the generalizability of the findings and potential sex-specific effects.</li><li><strong>Upper-Body Strength: Main Finding:</strong> Creatine supplementation combined with resistance training led to significantly greater increases in upper-body strength compared to placebo (WMD = 4.43 kg, p &lt; 0.001).  The I-squared value was 0%, indicating no significant heterogeneity between studies.  This finding supports the hypothesis that creatine supplementation enhances strength gains in the upper body.</li><li><strong>Lower-Body Strength: Main Finding:</strong> Creatine supplementation combined with resistance training also resulted in significantly greater increases in lower-body strength compared to placebo (WMD = 11.35 kg, p &lt; 0.001).  Similar to upper-body strength, there was no significant heterogeneity between studies (I-squared = 0%).  This finding further strengthens the evidence for creatine&#x27;s ergogenic effect on muscle strength.</li><li><strong>Subgroup Analyses:</strong> Subgroup analyses were performed for both upper- and lower-body strength to explore the influence of various factors, including creatine loading protocol, creatine dose, training duration, training frequency, training status, and sex.  While males experienced significant strength gains with creatine, females did not show significant improvements.  There was also a trend towards greater lower-body strength gains with higher doses of creatine.  These subgroup analyses provide insights into potential moderators of creatine&#x27;s effects.</li><li><strong>Publication Bias:</strong> Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger&#x27;s regression test.  A potential publication bias was detected for upper-body strength, but the adjusted effect size remained significant after applying the trim-and-fill method.  No publication bias was detected for lower-body strength.  Assessing publication bias is crucial for evaluating the robustness and reliability of the meta-analysis results.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Well-organized presentation of results</strong>
        <p>The results section systematically presents the findings of the meta-analysis, starting with the study selection process and progressing through the main outcomes and subgroup analyses. This structured approach facilitates reader comprehension and ensures all key findings are clearly presented.</p>
        <div class="quote">"3. Results" (Page 4)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive description of included studies</strong>
        <p>The authors provide clear and concise descriptions of the included studies&#x27; characteristics, including participant demographics, creatine protocols, and training protocols. This detailed information allows readers to understand the context of the meta-analysis and assess the generalizability of the findings.</p>

    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss magnitude of effects in relation to MCID</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion that would enhance the interpretation and clinical relevance of the findings. The Results section should include a discussion of the magnitude of the observed effects, such as by interpreting the WMD values in the context of minimal clinically important differences (MCID).  This would help readers understand the practical significance of the findings and whether the observed strength gains are meaningful in real-world scenarios.  Providing this context would strengthen the paper by bridging the gap between statistical significance and clinical relevance, making the results more impactful for practitioners and researchers.  Ultimately, discussing the magnitude of effects in relation to MCID would significantly improve the clinical applicability and translational value of the findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"WMD = 4.43 kg" (Page 7)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Interpret the WMD values for upper and lower body strength in the context of established MCIDs for these outcomes. If no established MCID exists, discuss the magnitude of the effects in relation to other relevant benchmarks or clinical guidelines. For example, &quot;The observed WMD of 4.43 kg for upper body strength exceeds the MCID of 2 kg reported by [reference], suggesting a clinically meaningful improvement.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Enhance forest plots with study weights and I-squared values</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion that would improve the clarity and visual appeal of the results. The figures presenting the forest plots (Figures 2 and 4) could be enhanced by including additional information, such as the study weights and I-squared values directly on the figures.  This would make the figures more self-explanatory and easier to interpret without needing to refer back to the text.  Adding this information directly to the figures would strengthen the paper by improving the visual presentation of the data and facilitating a quicker understanding of the meta-analysis results. This would also enhance the figures&#x27; suitability for presentations and other dissemination formats.  Ultimately, enhancing the forest plots with study weights and I-squared values would improve the clarity and accessibility of the key findings.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Figure 2." (Page 8)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Add the study weights (represented by the size of the squares in the forest plot) and the I-squared value for heterogeneity directly onto Figures 2 and 4. Ensure the figure legends clearly explain these additions.</p>

        <li><strong>Purpose and Structure</strong>: Table 2 presents the methodological quality scores for each of the 23 studies included in the systematic review. The quality assessment was performed using the PEDro scale, a tool specifically designed to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The PEDro scale consists of 11 items, each scored as either yes (1) or no (0), reflecting the presence or absence of a particular methodological feature that minimizes bias.  Items 2-9 contribute to the total PEDro score, with a maximum possible score of 10. Item 1 is related to external validity and is not included in the total score.</li><li><strong>Components of PEDro Scale</strong>: The PEDro scale assesses various aspects of trial methodology, such as random allocation, concealed allocation, baseline comparability between groups, blinding of participants, therapists, and assessors, reporting of dropouts, intention-to-treat analysis, and between-group statistical comparisons.</li><li><strong>Presentation of Data</strong>: The table lists each included study and provides a yes/no (Y/N) indication and numerical score (1/0) for each of the 11 PEDro scale items. A total PEDro score is calculated for each study (excluding Item 1) along with a quality assessment as &quot;excellent&quot; (9-10), &quot;good&quot; (6-8), &quot;fair&quot; (4-5), or &quot;poor&quot; (&lt;4).</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Use of PEDro Scale</strong>: Using the PEDro scale is a valid and widely accepted method for evaluating the methodological quality of RCTs in physiotherapy and related fields.  Its use strengthens the review&#x27;s validity by providing a standardized and transparent assessment of the included studies&#x27; methodological rigor.</li><li><strong>Reporting of Methodological Quality</strong>: While the categorization of studies as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; is helpful, the authors could strengthen the analysis by providing the average PEDro score and standard deviation for the included studies. This would offer a more nuanced understanding of the overall methodological quality. Additionally, explicitly stating the inter-rater reliability for the PEDro assessments (kappa statistic) would further reinforce the robustness of the quality assessment.</li></ul>

The table is easy to read and provides a clear overview of the quality assessment for each study.</li><li><strong>Explanation of Assessment Criteria</strong>: The table&#x27;s footnote explaining the scoring criteria is helpful. However, it might benefit from a more concise explanation of the criteria&#x27;s meaning, particularly for readers less familiar with the PEDro scale. For instance, providing a brief explanation of what &quot;baseline comparability&quot; or &quot;blinded assessors&quot; entails would enhance understanding.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose and Structure of the Table</strong>: Table 3 provides detailed information about the 23 studies included in the systematic review. Each row represents a single study, and the columns provide key characteristics of each study, including the authors, publication year, participant characteristics (training status, sex, number of participants, and age), and details about the creatine supplementation protocol (loading dose, maintenance does, and duration) and resistance training protocol (duration, sessions per week).</li><li><strong>Creatine Supplementation Protocols</strong>: The &quot;Creatine, Loading Protocol&quot; column describes the initial high-dose creatine supplementation strategy used in some studies to rapidly increase muscle creatine stores. The &quot;Creatine, Maintenance Protocol&quot; column describes the lower dose of creatine used after the loading phase to maintain elevated creatine levels.  Not all studies used a loading phase.</li><li><strong>Muscle Group Assessed</strong>: The table also provides details about the type of muscle group assessed (upper body, lower body, or both) which is crucial as the effects of interventions can vary depending on the muscle groups examined.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose of the figure: meta-analysis results</strong>: Figure 2 presents the results of a meta-analysis examining the effects of creatine supplementation combined with resistance training on upper-body strength. The figure uses a forest plot to visually display the effect sizes and confidence intervals from each of the included studies.</li><li><strong>Explanation of forest plot elements</strong>: A forest plot is a graphical representation commonly used in meta-analyses.  Each horizontal line in the plot represents a single study. The square box on each line represents the study&#x27;s effect size, with the size of the box indicating the study&#x27;s weight in the meta-analysis (larger boxes mean more weight). The horizontal lines extending from each box represent the 95% confidence intervals for each study&#x27;s effect size. If a confidence interval crosses the vertical line at zero, it indicates that the effect in that study is not statistically significant. The diamond at the bottom represents the pooled or overall effect size from all the studies combined, which takes into account the variability of results between individual studies. The width of the diamond represents the confidence interval for the pooled effect size.</li><li><strong>Explanation of WMD and confidence interval</strong>: The weighted mean difference (WMD) is a statistical measure of the difference between the mean outcomes in two groups.  In this case, it represents the difference in upper-body strength gains between the creatine group and the placebo group in kilograms.  The caption says that the pooled weighted mean difference is 4.43kg and is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The confidence interval for this difference is 3.12 kg to 5.75 kg. In layman&#x27;s terms, this means that people who took creatine gained, on average, 4.43kg more upper body strength compared to those who took the placebo.</li><li><strong>Explanation of random-effects model</strong>: A random-effects model is a statistical approach used in meta-analysis that assumes the true effect size varies between studies. This approach is often used when there is heterogeneity between the results of individual studies.  This model provides a more conservative estimate of the overall effect size.</li></ul>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Appropriate statistical methods</strong>: Using a forest plot and reporting the WMD, confidence intervals, and p-value are standard and appropriate methods for presenting meta-analysis results.  The use of a random-effects model is justified, especially if there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes of the individual studies.</li><li><strong>Assessment of heterogeneity</strong>: The forest plot allows for a visual inspection of the between-study heterogeneity. The figure itself does not display the heterogeneity statistically, so it&#x27;s difficult to fully assess the validity of choosing a random-effects model without knowing the extent of the heterogeneity (e.g., I-squared value).  Reporting the heterogeneity statistic would strengthen the analysis.</li><li><strong>Justification of random-effects model</strong>: The caption should clearly justify why a random-effects model is necessary, e.g., by stating that substantial heterogeneity was detected among included studies.  If the authors are certain that there is no heterogeneity, a fixed effects model could be used, though random-effects are almost always preferred as they are more conservative.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Clear presentation of meta-analysis results</strong>: The forest plot clearly visualizes the results of the meta-analysis, displaying the effect size (WMD) for each included study, along with the corresponding confidence intervals. This allows readers to assess the variability between studies and the precision of the overall effect estimate. The red circle representing the pooled WMD is visually prominent, effectively highlighting the overall effect of creatine supplementation.</li><li><strong>Use of WMD in kg</strong>: Expressing the effect size in kilograms (WMD) makes the results more interpretable and meaningful for readers, especially those interested in practical applications. This contrasts with other effect size metrics like standardized mean differences (SMD), which are less intuitive for understanding the magnitude of the effect in real-world terms.</li><li><strong>Clarity of caption</strong>: The figure&#x27;s caption clearly explains the key elements of the forest plot, including the meaning of the red circle and the use of a random-effects model.  However, it could be improved by briefly mentioning why a random-effects model was chosen.  Was there substantial heterogeneity between studies?  This would enhance the figure&#x27;s scientific rigor.</li></ul>

                <div class="quote">Six subgroup meta-analyses were performed (Figure 3) according to the characteristics of the creatine supplementation protocol (the existence of creatine loading and creatine dose), the characteristics of the resistance training protocol (duration and frequency of training), and the characteristics of the participants (training status and sex).</div>

        <li><strong>Purpose of subgroup analyses</strong>: Figure 3 presents the results of subgroup analyses conducted as part of the meta-analysis.  Subgroup analyses involve splitting the overall data into smaller groups (subgroups) based on specific characteristics (e.g., creatine loading, dose, training status, sex) to investigate whether the effects of creatine supplementation differ between these groups.</li><li><strong>Explanation of forest plot elements and statistical measures</strong>: The figure uses a forest plot format, similar to Figure 2, but each section now represents a different subgroup analysis.  The mean difference (MD) is shown as a square, with the size corresponding to the weight of each study. The horizontal lines are confidence intervals, and the diamond represents the pooled MD. P1 is the p-value for comparing pre- and post-training within each subgroup (does creatine have an effect in this group?). P2 is the p-value comparing the creatine effect *between* subgroups (do men and women respond differently?).</li><li><strong>Interpretation of subgroup analyses</strong>: Subgroup analyses help explore potential moderators of the treatment effect. For example, the analysis stratified by sex would reveal if creatine&#x27;s effect on muscle strength is similar in males and females.  Similarly, analyzing subgroups based on creatine dose (low vs. high) can help determine if there&#x27;s a dose-response relationship.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Rationale for subgroup analyses</strong>: Conducting subgroup analyses is a scientifically sound approach to exploring potential sources of heterogeneity in treatment effects. The selected subgrouping variables (creatine loading, dose, training characteristics, participant characteristics) are relevant to the research question and reflect factors that could plausibly influence the effects of creatine supplementation.</li><li><strong>Reporting of heterogeneity within subgroups</strong>: The authors should explicitly report the heterogeneity statistic (I-squared) for *each* subgroup analysis to provide a quantitative measure of variability within each subgroup.  This allows readers to assess whether the effect of creatine is consistent across studies within a given subgroup or if there are substantial differences.</li><li><strong>Statistical methods for between-subgroup comparisons</strong>: While the figure shows p-values (P2) for comparisons between subgroups, the authors should clearly state the statistical method used for these comparisons.  Commonly used methods include interaction tests or subgroup differences tests within the meta-analysis framework. Specifying the method used increases transparency and allows for critical evaluation of the subgroup findings.</li></ul>

The use of distinct visual elements (e.g., square size, diamond) to represent different statistical measures (MD, p-values) facilitates quick interpretation of the results. The overall layout is clear, making it easy to identify subgroups and corresponding effect sizes.</li><li><strong>Clarity of abbreviations and statistical tests</strong>: The figure caption clearly defines the abbreviations used (MD, P1, P2, NA), ensuring clarity and avoiding ambiguity. Explaining P1 and P2 in terms of within- and between-group comparisons further enhances understanding of the statistical analyses performed for each subgroup.</li><li><strong>Heterogeneity within subgroups</strong>: While the visual presentation is generally clear, adding numerical values for the I-squared statistic for each subgroup analysis directly on the forest plot would enhance the interpretation of heterogeneity within subgroups.  This would complement the p-values (P2) for between-subgroup heterogeneity.</li></ul>

        <li><strong>Purpose of funnel plot</strong>: Figure 6 presents a funnel plot, which is a scatterplot used in meta-analyses to visually assess publication bias. Publication bias arises when studies with statistically significant or positive results are more likely to be published than those with non-significant or negative results.</li><li><strong>Elements of a funnel plot</strong>: In a funnel plot, each dot represents a study. The x-axis represents the study&#x27;s effect size (strength of the effect of creatine in this case), and the y-axis represents a measure of the study&#x27;s precision, usually the standard error. Studies with high precision will cluster near the top and the spread should widen as precision decreases. In the absence of publication bias, the points form a roughly symmetrical inverted funnel shape. Asymmetry, as seen in Figure 6, can suggest publication bias.</li><li><strong>Trim and fill method</strong>: The trim and fill method is a technique used to address publication bias.

            <h3>4. Discussion</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Overall Effects of Creatine on Strength:</strong> The meta-analysis revealed that creatine supplementation, when combined with resistance training, significantly enhances both upper and lower body strength in adults under 50 compared to resistance training with a placebo.  The average increase in upper body strength was 4.43 kg, while the average increase in lower body strength was a more substantial 11.35 kg.  These findings confirm the primary hypothesis of the study and align with previous research indicating the ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation for strength gains.  The use of weighted mean differences (WMD) in kilograms allows for a practical interpretation of the effect size, indicating the average strength gain attributable to creatine supplementation.</li><li><strong>Subgroup Analyses and Moderating Factors:</strong> Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the influence of various factors on the effects of creatine supplementation.  These factors included the presence of a creatine loading phase, creatine dosage (≤5 g/d vs. &gt;5 g/d), training duration, training frequency, training status (trained vs. untrained), and biological sex.  While males demonstrated significant strength gains with creatine supplementation, females did not experience statistically significant improvements.  There was also a trend towards greater lower body strength gains with higher doses of creatine.  These subgroup analyses provide valuable insights into potential moderators of creatine&#x27;s effects and highlight the importance of considering individual characteristics when designing supplementation strategies.</li><li><strong>Practical Applications for Resistance Training:</strong> The discussion addresses the practical implications of the findings for resistance training enthusiasts.  It suggests that creatine supplementation, regardless of the loading protocol, can significantly enhance strength gains.  The discussion also notes that higher doses of creatine (&gt;5 g/day) may be more beneficial for lower body strength.  This information is valuable for athletes and individuals involved in resistance training who are seeking to optimize their supplementation strategies for maximal strength gains.  The discussion emphasizes the importance of individualizing creatine dosage based on body weight and training goals.</li><li><strong>Limitations of the Study:</strong> The discussion acknowledges several limitations of the study, including the variability in creatine doses and supplementation durations across the included studies, the heterogeneity of resistance training protocols, the limited number of studies involving female participants, and the lack of analysis of other factors like timing of creatine intake and combination with other substances.  These limitations are important to consider when interpreting the findings and highlight areas for future research.  Acknowledging these limitations strengthens the discussion by demonstrating the authors&#x27; awareness of potential biases and the need for further investigation to address these limitations.</li><li><strong>Future Research Directions:</strong> The discussion proposes future research directions based on the identified limitations and unanswered questions.  It suggests investigating the optimal resistance training protocols for maximizing the benefits of creatine supplementation, exploring sex differences in greater detail, and examining the influence of other factors like timing of creatine intake and combination with other substances.  These suggestions provide a roadmap for future research and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of sports nutrition and exercise science.  By highlighting these future directions, the discussion enhances the impact and relevance of the study&#x27;s findings.</li>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Clear summary of main findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion effectively summarizes the main findings of the meta-analysis, highlighting the significant improvement in upper and lower body strength with creatine supplementation combined with resistance training in adults under 50.</p>
        <div class="quote">"The most important findings from the meta-analyses were that: (1) the combination of creatine supplementation and resistance training results in greater strength gains" (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Contextualization of findings</strong>
        <p>The discussion provides context for the findings by referencing previous meta-analyses and discussing the potential mechanisms underlying the observed effects of creatine supplementation on muscle strength.</p>
        <div class="quote">"These results support previous meta-analyses [9–11,45] which showed that creatine supplementation increased measures of upper- and lower-body maximal strength." (Page 12)</div>
    </li>
    
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
            
    <li>
        <strong>Discuss clinical significance of strength gains</strong>
        
        <p>This is a high-impact suggestion as it strengthens the discussion by providing a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. The discussion should elaborate on the clinical significance of the observed strength gains. While the meta-analysis reports the WMD in kg, it lacks a discussion of whether these gains are practically meaningful for athletes and individuals engaged in resistance training.  Adding a discussion of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) or other relevant benchmarks would provide valuable context and enhance the practical implications of the findings. This would also strengthen the paper&#x27;s contribution to the field by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of creatine supplementation.</p>
        <div class="quote">"with a 4.43 kg benefit for upper-body strength and an 11.35 kg benefit for lower-body strength." (Page 12)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Include a discussion of the MCID for strength gains in the context of resistance training. If an established MCID is available, compare the observed WMD values to the MCID. If not, discuss the magnitude of the effects in relation to other relevant benchmarks or practical guidelines. For example, &quot;The observed WMD of 11.35 kg for lower-body strength represents a substantial increase, exceeding the MCID of X kg reported by [reference], suggesting a clinically meaningful improvement.&quot;</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Elaborate on potential reasons for sex differences</strong>
        
        <p>This is a medium-impact suggestion that would improve the discussion&#x27;s depth and connect it more strongly to the results. The discussion mentions the subgroup analysis on sex differences but could be strengthened by exploring the potential reasons for the observed differences in more detail.  Elaborating on the potential physiological and hormonal factors contributing to the blunted response in females would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the findings. This would also enhance the discussion&#x27;s scientific rigor and contribute to a more nuanced interpretation of the results.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Mechanistically, the blunted response in females may be related to higher pre-supplementation intramuscular creatine levels" (Page 13)</div>
        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Expand the discussion on sex differences by elaborating on the potential physiological and hormonal factors that may contribute to the blunted response to creatine supplementation in females. Discuss factors such as higher pre-supplementation intramuscular creatine levels, differences in amino acid catabolism, and the influence of menstrual cycle fluctuations and estrogen levels.  For example, &quot;The blunted response in females may be related to higher baseline intramuscular creatine levels, as reported by [reference], which could limit the potential for further increases with supplementation.&quot;</p>

            <h3>5. Conclusions</h3>
            
            <h4>Key Aspects</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Creatine Enhances Strength Gains:</strong> The primary finding of this meta-analysis is that creatine supplementation, when combined with resistance training, significantly improves both upper and lower body muscle strength in healthy individuals under 50 years of age, compared to resistance training alone. This is analogous to adding fertilizer to a plant that is already receiving water and sunlight; the fertilizer (creatine) further enhances the plant&#x27;s growth (strength gains) beyond what would be achieved with just water and sunlight (resistance training).</li><li><strong>Quantified Strength Improvements:</strong> The meta-analysis quantified the strength gains observed with creatine supplementation. Upper body strength improved by an average of 4.43 kg, while lower body strength showed a more substantial improvement of 11.35 kg. This difference in magnitude may be due to the greater muscle mass involved in lower body exercises, providing more tissue for creatine to exert its effects. It&#x27;s like having a larger engine (more muscle mass) that can generate more power (strength gains) when given the right fuel (creatine).</li><li><strong>Sex-Specific Effects:</strong> The benefits of creatine supplementation appear to be more pronounced in males than in females. This sex difference may be related to physiological factors such as higher baseline creatine levels in females, which could limit the potential for further increases with supplementation. It&#x27;s like trying to fill a glass that is already nearly full; there&#x27;s less room for additional liquid (creatine).</li><li><strong>Future Research on Training Protocols:</strong> The conclusion highlights the need for future research to investigate the optimal resistance training protocols for maximizing the benefits of creatine supplementation. This is crucial for developing evidence-based training and supplementation strategies for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It&#x27;s like fine-tuning a recipe; by adjusting the ingredients (training protocols) and their proportions, we can achieve the best possible outcome (maximal strength gains).</li><li><strong>Future Research on Sex Differences:</strong> The conclusion also emphasizes the importance of addressing the imbalance in male and female representation in creatine research. This is essential for developing more generalizable supplementation strategies that cater to the specific needs of both sexes. It&#x27;s like designing a car that is comfortable and safe for both men and women; we need to consider the unique characteristics of each group to create a product that works well for everyone.</li>
